          list of [% terms.bugs %] and must be processed. [% terms.Bugs %] in
          this state may be accepted, and become <b>[% status_descs.ASSIGNED FILTER html %]</b>, passed

          This [% terms.bug %] is not yet resolved, but is assigned to the

          This [% terms.bug %] was once resolved, but the resolution was

          the [% terms.bug %] is now reproducible. From here [% terms.bugs %] are

          All attempts at reproducing this [% terms.bug %] were futile,

    <td>Only allowed for releases or mega regressions. Do not set a bug to blocker unless you are the Testing Coordinator.</td>

<h2><a name="priority">Priority</a></h2>
This field describes the importance and order in which [% terms.abug %]
should be fixed. This field is utilized by the
programmers/engineers to prioritize their work to be done. The
available priorities range from <b>P1</b> (most important) to 
<b>P5</b> (least important). 


<h2><a name="rep_platform">Platform</a></h2>
This is the hardware platform against which the [% terms.bug %] was
reported. Legal platforms include: 

<ul>
  <li>All (happens on all platforms; cross-platform [% terms.bug %])</li>
  <li>x86</li>
  <li>QEmu</li>
  <li>VMware</li>
  <li>Virtual PC</li>
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> When searching, selecting the option "All" does not 
select [% terms.bugs %]
assigned against any platform. It merely selects [% terms.bugs %] that are
marked as occurring on all platforms, i.e. are designated "All". 

<h2><a name="op_sys">Operating System</a></h2>
This is the operating system against which the [% terms.bug %] was
reported. Legal operating systems include: 

<ul>
  <li>All (happens on all operating systems; cross-platform
  [% terms.bug %])</li>
  <li>ReactOS</li>
  <li>Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista</li>
  <li>Windows 95, 98, ME</li>
</ul>
Sometimes the operating system implies the platform, but not
always. For example, Linux can run on PC and Macintosh and
others. 

<h2><a name="assigned_to">Assigned To</a></h2>

<p>
This is the person in charge of resolving the [% terms.bug %]. Every time
this field changes, the status changes to <b>[% status_descs.NEW FILTER html %]</b> to make it
easy to see which new [% terms.bugs %] have appeared on a person's list.</p>

<p>
The default status for queries is set to [% status_descs.NEW FILTER html %], [% descs.bug_status_descs.ASSIGNED FILTER html %] and 
[% status_descs.REOPENED FILTER html %]. When searching for [% terms.bugs %] that have been resolved or
verified, remember to set the status field appropriately.
