Chapter 2. Installing Bugzilla

2.1. Installation

   Note If you just want to use Bugzilla, you do not need to install it. None
   of this chapter is relevant to you. Ask your Bugzilla administrator for the
      URL to access it over the web.

   The Bugzilla server software is usually installed on Linux or Solaris. If
   you are installing on another OS, check Section 2.5 before you start your
   installation to see if there are any special instructions.

   As an alternative to following these instructions, you may wish to try Arne
   Schirmacher's unofficial and unsupported Bugzilla Installer, which installs
   Bugzilla and all its prerequisites on Linux or Solaris systems.

   This guide assumes that you have administrative access to the Bugzilla
   machine. It not possible to install and run Bugzilla itself without
   administrative access except in the very unlikely event that every single
   prerequisite is already installed.

   Warning The installation process may make your machine insecure for short
      periods of time. Make sure there is a firewall between you and the Internet.

   You are strongly recommended to make a backup of your system before
   installing Bugzilla (and at regular intervals thereafter :-).

   In outline, the installation proceeds as follows:
    1. Install Perl (5.8.0 or above for non-Windows platforms; 5.8.1 for
       Windows)
    2. Install a Database Engine
    3. Install a Webserver
    4. Install Bugzilla
    5. Install Perl modules
    6. Install a Mail Transfer Agent (Sendmail 8.7 or above, or an MTA that is
       Sendmail-compatible with at least this version)
    7. Configure all of the above.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.1. Perl

   Installed Version Test: perl -v

   Any machine that doesn't have Perl on it is a sad machine indeed. If you
   don't have it and your OS doesn't provide official packages, visit
   http://www.perl.com. Although Bugzilla runs with Perl 5.8.0, it's a good
   idea to be using the latest stable version.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.2. Database Engine

   From Bugzilla 2.20, support is included for using both the MySQL and
   PostgreSQL database servers. You only require one of these systems to make
   use of Bugzilla.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.2.1. MySQL

   Installed Version Test: mysql -V

   If you don't have it and your OS doesn't provide official packages, visit
   http://www.mysql.com. You need MySQL version 4.1.2 or higher.

   Note Many of the binary versions of MySQL store their data files in /var. On
   some Unix systems, this is part of a smaller root partition, and may not
   have room for your bug database. To change the data directory, you have to
      build MySQL from source yourself, and set it as an option to configure.

   If you install from something other than a packaging/installation system,
   such as .rpm (Redhat Package), .deb (Debian Package), .exe (Windows
   Executable), or .msi (Microsoft Installer), make sure the MySQL server is
   started when the machine boots.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.2.2. PostgreSQL

   Installed Version Test: psql -V

   If you don't have it and your OS doesn't provide official packages, visit
   http://www.postgresql.org/. You need PostgreSQL version 8.00.0000 or higher.

   If you install from something other than a packaging/installation system,
   such as .rpm (Redhat Package), .deb (Debian Package), .exe (Windows
   Executable), or .msi (Microsoft Installer), make sure the PostgreSQL server
   is started when the machine boots.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.3. Web Server

   Installed Version Test: view the default welcome page at
   http://<your-machine>/

   You have freedom of choice here, pretty much any web server that is capable
   of running CGI scripts will work. However, we strongly recommend using the
   Apache web server (either 1.3.x or 2.x), and the installation instructions
   usually assume you are using it. If you have got Bugzilla working using
   another webserver, please share your experiences with us by filing a bug in
   Bugzilla Documentation.

   If you don't have Apache and your OS doesn't provide official packages,
   visit http://httpd.apache.org/.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.4. Bugzilla

   Download a Bugzilla tarball (or check it out from CVS) and place it in a
   suitable directory, accessible by the default web server user (probably
   "apache" or "www"). Good locations are either directly in the main web space
   for your web server or perhaps in /usr/local with a symbolic link from the
   web space.

   Caution The default Bugzilla distribution is NOT designed to be placed in a
   cgi-bin directory. This includes any directory which is configured using the
      ScriptAlias directive of Apache.

   Once all the files are in a web accessible directory, make that directory
   writable by your webserver's user. This is a temporary step until you run
   the checksetup.pl script, which locks down your installation.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5. Perl Modules

   Bugzilla's installation process is based on a script called checksetup.pl.
   The first thing it checks is whether you have appropriate versions of all
   the required Perl modules. The aim of this section is to pass this check.
   When it passes, proceed to Section 2.2.

   At this point, you need to su to root. You should remain as root until the
   end of the install. To check you have the required modules, run:
   bash# ./checksetup.pl --check-modules

   checksetup.pl will print out a list of the required and optional Perl
   modules, together with the versions (if any) installed on your machine. The
   list of required modules is reasonably long; however, you may already have
   several of them installed.

   There is a meta-module called Bundle::Bugzilla, which installs all the other
   modules with a single command. You should use this if you are running Perl
   5.6.1 or above.

   The preferred way of installing Perl modules is via CPAN on Unix, or PPM on
   Windows (see Section 2.5.1.2). These instructions assume you are using CPAN;
   if for some reason you need to install the Perl modules manually, see
   Appendix D.
   bash# perl -MCPAN -e 'install "<modulename>"'

   If you using Bundle::Bugzilla, invoke the magic CPAN command on it.
   Otherwise, you need to work down the list of modules that checksetup.pl says
   are required, in the order given, invoking the command on each.

   Tip Many people complain that Perl modules will not install for them. Most
   times, the error messages complain that they are missing a file in "@INC".
   Virtually every time, this error is due to permissions being set too
   restrictively for you to compile Perl modules or not having the necessary
   Perl development libraries installed on your system. Consult your local UNIX
   systems administrator for help solving these permissions issues; if you are
   the local UNIX sysadmin, please consult the newsgroup/mailing list for
      further assistance or hire someone to help you out.

   Note If you are using a package-based system, and attempting to install the
   Perl modules from CPAN, you may need to install the "development" packages
   for MySQL and GD before attempting to install the related Perl modules. The
   names of these packages will vary depending on the specific distribution you
      are using, but are often called <packagename>-devel.

   Here is a complete list of modules and their minimum versions. Some modules
   have special installation notes, which follow.

   Required Perl modules:

    1. CGI 2.93 or CGI 3.11 if using mod_perl
    2. Date::Format (2.21)
    3. DBI (1.41)
    4. DBD::mysql (2.9003) if using MySQL
    5. DBD::Pg (1.45) if using PostgreSQL
    6. File::Spec (0.84)
    7. Template (2.12)
    8. Email::Send (2.00)
    9. Email::MIME::Modifier (any)

   Optional Perl modules:

    1. GD (1.20) for bug charting
    2. Template::Plugin::GD::Image (1.20) for Graphical Reports
    3. Chart::Base (1.0) for bug charting
    4. GD::Graph (any) for bug charting
    5. GD::Text (any) for bug charting
    6. XML::Twig (any) for bug import/export
    7. MIME::Parser (5.406) for bug import/export
    8. LWP::UserAgent (any) for Automatic Update Notifications
    9. PatchReader (0.9.4) for pretty HTML view of patches
   10. Image::Magick (any) for converting BMP image attachments to PNG
   11. Net::LDAP (any) for LDAP Authentication
   12. SOAP::Lite (any) for the web service interface
   13. HTML::Parser (3.40) for More HTML in Product/Group Descriptions

   15. Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper (any) for Inbound Email
   16. Email::Reply (any) for Inbound Email
   17. mod_perl2 (1.999022) for mod_perl
   18. CGI (2.93) for mod_perl
   19. Apache::DBI (0.96) for mod_perl2
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.1. DBD::mysql

   The installation process will ask you a few questions about the desired
   compilation target and your MySQL installation. For most of the questions
   the provided default will be adequate, but when asked if your desired target
   is the MySQL or mSQL packages, you should select the MySQL-related ones.
   Later you will be asked if you wish to provide backwards compatibility with
   the older MySQL packages; you should answer YES to this question. The
   default is NO.

   A host of 'localhost' should be fine. A testing user of 'test', with a null
   password, should have sufficient access to run tests on the 'test' database
   which MySQL creates upon installation.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.2. Template Toolkit (2.12)

   When you install Template Toolkit, you'll get asked various questions about
   features to enable. The defaults are fine, except that it is recommended you
   use the high speed XS Stash of the Template Toolkit, in order to achieve
   best performance.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.3. GD (1.20)

   The GD module is only required if you want graphical reports.

   Note The Perl GD module requires some other libraries that may or may not be
   installed on your system, including libpng and libgd. The full requirements
   are listed in the Perl GD module README. If compiling GD fails, it's
      probably because you're missing a required library.

   Tip The version of the GD module you need is very closely tied to the libgd
   version installed on your system. If you have a version 1.x of libgd the 2.x
      versions of the GD module won't work for you.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.4. Chart::Base (1.0)

   The Chart::Base module is only required if you want graphical reports. Note
   that earlier versions that 0.99c used GIFs, which are no longer supported by
   the latest versions of GD.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.5. GD::Graph (any)

   The GD::Graph module is only required if you want graphical reports.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.6. GD::Text (any)

   The GD::Text module is only required if you want graphical reports.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.7. XML::Twig (any)

   The XML::Twig module is only required if you want to import XML bugs using
   the importxml.pl script. This is required to use Bugzilla's "move bugs"
   feature; you may also want to use it for migrating from another bug
   database.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.8. SOAP::Lite (any)

   Installing SOAP::Lite enables your Bugzilla installation to be accessible at
   a standardized Web Service interface (SOAP/XML-RPC) by third-party
   applications via HTTP(S).
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.5.9. PatchReader (0.9.4)

   The PatchReader module is only required if you want to use Patch Viewer, a
   Bugzilla feature to show code patches in your web browser in a more readable
   form.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.6. Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)

   Bugzilla is dependent on the availability of an e-mail system for its user
   authentication and for other tasks.

   Note This is not entirely true. It is possible to completely disable email
   sending, or to have Bugzilla store email messages in a file instead of
   sending them. However, this is mainly intended for testing, as disabling or
   diverting email on a production machine would mean that users could miss
   important events (such as bug changes or the creation of new accounts).

   For more information, see the "mail_delivery_method" parameter in Section
      3.1.

   On Linux, any Sendmail-compatible MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) will suffice.
   Sendmail, Postfix, qmail and Exim are examples of common MTAs. Sendmail is
   the original Unix MTA, but the others are easier to configure, and therefore
   many people replace Sendmail with Postfix or Exim. They are drop-in
   replacements, so Bugzilla will not distinguish between them.

   If you are using Sendmail, version 8.7 or higher is required. If you are
   using a Sendmail-compatible MTA, it must be congruent with at least version
   8.7 of Sendmail.

   Consult the manual for the specific MTA you choose for detailed installation
   instructions. Each of these programs will have their own configuration files
   where you must configure certain parameters to ensure that the mail is
   delivered properly. They are implemented as services, and you should ensure
   that the MTA is in the auto-start list of services for the machine.

   If a simple mail sent with the command-line 'mail' program succeeds, then
   Bugzilla should also be fine.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.1.7. Installing Bugzilla on mod_perl

   It is now possible to run the Bugzilla software under mod_perl on Apache.
   mod_perl has some additional requirements to that of running Bugzilla under
   mod_cgi (the standard and previous way).

   Bugzilla requires mod_perl to be installed, which can be obtained from
   http://perl.apache.org - Bugzilla requires version 1.999022 (AKA 2.0.0-RC5)
   to be installed.

   Bugzilla also requires a more up-to-date version of the CGI perl module to
   be installed, version 3.11 as opposed to 2.93

   Finally, Bugzilla also requires Apache::DBI (0.96) to be installed as well.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2. Configuration

   Warning Poorly-configured MySQL and Bugzilla installations have given
   attackers full access to systems in the past. Please take the security parts
   of these guidelines seriously, even for Bugzilla machines hidden away behind
   your firewall. Be certain to read Chapter 4 for some important security
      tips.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.1. localconfig

   You should now run checksetup.pl again, this time without the
   --check-modules switch.
   bash# ./checksetup.pl

   This time, checksetup.pl should tell you that all the correct modules are
   installed and will display a message about, and write out a file called,
   localconfig. This file contains the default settings for a number of
   Bugzilla parameters.

   Load this file in your editor. The only value you need to change is
   $db_pass, the password for the user you will create for your database. Pick
   a strong password (for simplicity, it should not contain single quote
   characters) and put it here.

   You may need to change the value of webservergroup if your web server does
   not run in the "apache" group. On Debian, for example, Apache runs in the
   "www-data" group. If you are going to run Bugzilla on a machine where you do
   not have root access (such as on a shared web hosting account), you will
   need to leave webservergroup empty, ignoring the warnings that checksetup.pl
   will subsequently display every time it in run.

   The other options in the localconfig file are documented by their
   accompanying comments. If you have a slightly non-standard MySQL setup, you
   may wish to change one or more of the other "$db_*" parameters.

   You may also wish to change the names of the priorities, severities,
   operating systems and platforms for your installation. However, you can
   always change these after installation has finished; if you then re-run
   checksetup.pl, the changes will get picked up.

2.2.2. Database Server

   This section deals with configuring your database server for use with
   Bugzilla. Currently, MySQL (Section 2.2.2.2) and PostgreSQL (Section
   2.2.2.3) are available.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.2.1. Bugzilla Database Schema

   The Bugzilla database schema is available at Ravenbrook. This very valuable
   tool can generate a written description of the Bugzilla database schema for
   any version of Bugzilla. It can also generate a diff between two versions to
   help someone see what has changed.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.2.2. MySQL

   Caution MySQL's default configuration is very insecure. Section 4.2 has some
      good information for improving your installation's security.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.2.2.1. Allow large attachments

   By default, MySQL will only accept packets up to 64Kb in size. If you want
   to have attachments larger than this, you will need to modify your
   /etc/my.cnf as below.
  [mysqld]
  # Allow packets up to 1M
  max_allowed_packet=1M

   There is also a parameter in Bugzilla called 'maxattachmentsize' (default =
   1000 Kb) that controls the maximum allowable attachment size. Attachments
   larger than either the 'max_allowed_packet' or 'maxattachmentsize' value
   will not be accepted by Bugzilla.

   Note This does not affect Big Files, attachments that are stored directly on
   disk instead of in the database. Their maximum size is controlled using the
      'maxlocalattachment' parameter.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.2.2.2. Allow small words in full-text indexes

   By default, words must be at least four characters in length in order to be
   indexed by MySQL's full-text indexes. This causes a lot of Bugzilla specific
   words to be missed, including "cc", "ftp" and "uri".

   MySQL can be configured to index those words by setting the ft_min_word_len
   param to the minimum size of the words to index. This can be done by
   modifying the /etc/my.cnf according to the example below:
  [mysqld]
  # Allow small words in full-text indexes
  ft_min_word_len=2

   Rebuilding the indexes can be done based on documentation found at
   http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Fulltext_Fine-tuning.html.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.2.2.3. Add a user to MySQL

   You need to add a new MySQL user for Bugzilla to use. (It's not safe to have
   Bugzilla use the MySQL root account.) The following instructions assume the
   defaults in localconfig; if you changed those, you need to modify the SQL
   command appropriately. You will need the $db_pass password you set in
   localconfig in Section 2.2.1.

   We use an SQL GRANT command to create a "bugs" user. This also restricts the
   "bugs"user to operations within a database called "bugs", and only allows
   the account to connect from "localhost". Modify it to reflect your setup if
   you will be connecting from another machine or as a different user.

   Run the mysql command-line client and enter:
  mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT,
           UPDATE, DELETE, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE, LOCK TABLES,
           CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, DROP, REFERENCES ON bugs.*
           TO bugs@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '$db_pass';
           mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.2.2.4. Permit attachments table to grow beyond 4GB

   By default, MySQL will limit the size of a table to 4GB. This limit is
   present even if the underlying filesystem has no such limit. To set a higher
   limit, follow these instructions.

   After you have completed the rest of the installation (or at least the
   database setup parts), you should run the MySQL command-line client and
   enter the following, replacing $bugs_db with your Bugzilla database name
   (bugs by default):
            mysql> use $bugs_db
            mysql> ALTER TABLE attachments
            AVG_ROW_LENGTH=1000000, MAX_ROWS=20000;

   The above command will change the limit to 20GB. Mysql will have to make a
   temporary copy of your entire table to do this. Ideally, you should do this
   when your attachments table is still small.

   Note This does not affect Big Files, attachments that are stored directly on
      disk instead of in the database.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.2.3. PostgreSQL

2.2.2.3.1. Add a User to PostgreSQL

   You need to add a new user to PostgreSQL for the Bugzilla application to use
   when accessing the database. The following instructions assume the defaults
   in localconfig; if you changed those, you need to modify the commands
   appropriately. You will need the $db_pass password you set in localconfig in
   Section 2.2.1.

   On most systems, to create the user in PostgreSQL, you will need to login as
   the root user, and then
    bash# su - postgres

   As the postgres user, you then need to create a new user:
    bash$ createuser -U postgres -dAP bugs

   When asked for a password, provide the password which will be set as
   $db_pass in localconfig. The created user will have the ability to create
   databases and will not be able to create new users.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.2.3.2. Configure PostgreSQL

   Now, you will need to edit pg_hba.conf which is usually located in
   /var/lib/pgsql/data/. In this file, you will need to add a new line to it as
   follows:

   host all bugs 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.255 md5

   This means that for TCP/IP (host) connections, allow connections from
   '127.0.0.1' to 'all' databases on this server from the 'bugs' user, and use
   password authentication (md5) for that user.

   Now, you will need to restart PostgreSQL, but you will need to fully stop
   and start the server rather than just restarting due to the possibility of a
   change to postgresql.conf. After the server has restarted, you will need to
   edit localconfig, finding the $db_driver variable and setting it to Pg and
   changing the password in $db_pass to the one you picked previously, while
   setting up the account.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.3. checksetup.pl

   Next, rerun checksetup.pl. It reconfirms that all the modules are present,
   and notices the altered localconfig file, which it assumes you have edited
   to your satisfaction. It compiles the UI templates, connects to the database
   using the 'bugs' user you created and the password you defined, and creates
   the 'bugs' database and the tables therein.

   After that, it asks for details of an administrator account. Bugzilla can
   have multiple administrators - you can create more later - but it needs one
   to start off with. Enter the email address of an administrator, his or her
   full name, and a suitable Bugzilla password.

   checksetup.pl will then finish. You may rerun checksetup.pl at any time if
   you wish.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.4. Web server

   Configure your web server according to the instructions in the appropriate
   section. (If it makes a difference in your choice, the Bugzilla Team
   recommends Apache.) To check whether your web server is correctly
   configured, try to access testagent.cgi from your web server. If "OK" is
   displayed, then your configuration is successful. Regardless of which web
   server you are using, however, ensure that sensitive information is not
   remotely available by properly applying the access controls in Section
   4.3.1. You can run testserver.pl to check if your web server serves
   Bugzilla files as expected.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.4.1. Bugzilla using Apache

   You have two options for running Bugzilla under Apache - mod_cgi (the
   default) and mod_perl (new in Bugzilla 2.23)
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.4.1.1. Apache httpd with mod_cgi

   To configure your Apache web server to work with Bugzilla while using
   mod_cgi, do the following:
    1. Load httpd.conf in your editor. In Fedora and Red Hat Linux, this file
       is found in /etc/httpd/conf.
    2. Apache uses <Directory> directives to permit fine-grained permission
       setting. Add the following lines to a directive that applies to the
       location of your Bugzilla installation. (If such a section does not
       exist, you'll want to add one.) In this example, Bugzilla has been
       installed at /var/www/html/bugzilla.

    <Directory /var/www/html/bugzilla>
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    Options +Indexes +ExecCGI
    DirectoryIndex index.cgi
    AllowOverride Limit
       </Directory>
       These instructions: allow apache to run .cgi files found within the
       bugzilla directory; instructs the server to look for a file called
       index.cgi if someone only types the directory name into the browser; and
       allows Bugzilla's .htaccess files to override global permissions.

       Note It is possible to make these changes globally, or to the directive
   controlling Bugzilla's parent directory (e.g. <Directory /var/www/html/>).
   Such changes would also apply to the Bugzilla directory... but they would
   also apply to many other places where they may or may not be appropriate. In
   most cases, including this one, it is better to be as restrictive as
      possible when granting extra access.
    3. checksetup.pl can set tighter permissions on Bugzilla's files and
       directories if it knows what group the webserver runs as. Find the Group
       line in httpd.conf, place the value found there in the $webservergroup
       variable in localconfig, then rerun checksetup.pl.
    4. Optional: If Bugzilla does not actually reside in the webspace
       directory, but instead has been symbolically linked there, you will need
       to add the following to the Options line of the Bugzilla <Directory>
       directive (the same one as in the step above):

           +FollowSymLinks
       Without this directive, Apache will not follow symbolic links to places
       outside its own directory structure, and you will be unable to run
       Bugzilla.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.4.1.2. Apache httpd with mod_perl

   Some configuration is required to make Bugzilla work with Apache and
   mod_perl
    1. Load httpd.conf in your editor. In Fedora and Red Hat Linux, this file
       is found in /etc/httpd/conf.
    2. Add the following information to your httpd.conf file, substituting
       where appropriate with your own local paths.

    Note This should be used instead of the <Directory> block shown above. This
   should also be above any other mod_perl directives within the httpd.conf and
      must be specified in the order as below.

     Warning You should also ensure that you have disabled KeepAlive support in
      your Apache install when utilizing Bugzilla under mod_perl

    PerlSwitches -I/var/www/html/bugzilla -w -T
       PerlConfigRequire /var/www/html/bugzilla/mod_perl.pl
    3. checksetup.pl can set tighter permissions on Bugzilla's files and
       directories if it knows what group the webserver runs as. Find the Group
       line in httpd.conf, place the value found there in the $webservergroup
       variable in localconfig, then rerun checksetup.pl.

   On restarting Apache, Bugzilla should now be running within the mod_perl
   environment. Please ensure you have run checksetup.pl to set permissions
   before you restart Apache.

   Note Please bear the following points in mind when looking at using Bugzilla
   under mod_perl:

     * mod_perl support in Bugzilla can take up a HUGE amount of RAM. You could
       be looking at 30MB per httpd child, easily. Basically, you just need a
       lot of RAM. The more RAM you can get, the better. mod_perl is basically
       trading RAM for speed. At least 2GB total system RAM is recommended for
       running Bugzilla under mod_perl.
     * Under mod_perl, you have to restart Apache if you make any manual change
       to any Bugzilla file. You can't just reload--you have to actually
       restart the server (as in make sure it stops and starts again). You can
       change localconfig and the params file manually, if you want, because
       those are re-read every time you load a page.
     * You must run in Apache's Prefork MPM (this is the default). The Worker
       MPM may not work--we haven't tested Bugzilla's mod_perl support under
       threads. (And, in fact, we're fairly sure it won't work.)
     * Bugzilla generally expects to be the only mod_perl application running
       on your entire server. It may or may not work if there are other
       applications also running under mod_perl. It does try its best to play
       nice with other mod_perl applications, but it still may have conflicts.
     * It is recommended that you have one Bugzilla instance running under
       mod_perl on your server. Bugzilla has not been tested with more than one
          instance running.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.4.2. Microsoft Internet Information Services

   If you are running Bugzilla on Windows and choose to use Microsoft's
   Internet Information Services or Personal Web Server you will need to
   perform a number of other configuration steps as explained below. You may
   also want to refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles:
   245225 "HOW TO: Configure and Test a PERL Script with IIS 4.0, 5.0, and 5.1"
   (for Internet Information Services) and 231998 "HOW TO: FP2000: How to Use
   Perl with Microsoft Personal Web Server on Windows 95/98" (for Personal Web
   Server).

   You will need to create a virtual directory for the Bugzilla install. Put
   the Bugzilla files in a directory that is named something other than what
   you want your end-users accessing. That is, if you want your users to access
   your Bugzilla installation through "http://<yourdomainname>/Bugzilla", then
   do not put your Bugzilla files in a directory named "Bugzilla". Instead,
   place them in a different location, and then use the IIS Administration tool
   to create a Virtual Directory named "Bugzilla" that acts as an alias for the
   actual location of the files. When creating that virtual directory, make
   sure you add the "Execute (such as ISAPI applications or CGI)" access
   permission.

   You will also need to tell IIS how to handle Bugzilla's .cgi files. Using
   the IIS Administration tool again, open up the properties for the new
   virtual directory and select the Configuration option to access the Script
   Mappings. Create an entry mapping .cgi to:
<full path to perl.exe >\perl.exe -x<full path to Bugzilla> -wT "%s" %s

   For example:
c:\perl\bin\perl.exe -xc:\bugzilla -wT "%s" %s

   Note The ActiveState install may have already created an entry for .pl files
   that is limited to "GET,HEAD,POST". If so, this mapping should be removed as
      Bugzilla's .pl files are not designed to be run via a webserver.

   IIS will also need to know that the index.cgi should be treated as a default
   document. On the Documents tab page of the virtual directory properties, you
   need to add index.cgi as a default document type. If you wish, you may
   remove the other default document types for this particular virtual
   directory, since Bugzilla doesn't use any of them.

   Also, and this can't be stressed enough, make sure that files such as
   localconfig and your data directory are secured as described in Section
   4.3.1.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2.5. Bugzilla

   Your Bugzilla should now be working. Access http://<your-bugzilla-server>/ -
   you should see the Bugzilla front page. If not, consult the Troubleshooting
   section, Appendix B.

   Note The URL above may be incorrect if you installed Bugzilla into a
   subdirectory or used a symbolic link from your web site root to the Bugzilla
      directory.

   Log in with the administrator account you defined in the last checksetup.pl
   run. You should go through the parameters on the Edit Parameters page (see
   link in the footer) and see if there are any you wish to change. They key
   parameters are documented in Section 3.1; you should certainly alter
   maintainer and urlbase; you may also want to alter cookiepath or
   requirelogin.

   This would also be a good time to revisit the localconfig file and make sure
   that the names of the priorities, severities, platforms and operating
   systems are those you wish to use when you start creating bugs. Remember to
   rerun checksetup.pl if you change it.

   Bugzilla has several optional features which require extra configuration.
   You can read about those in Section 2.3.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3. Optional Additional Configuration

   Bugzilla has a number of optional features. This section describes how to
   configure or enable them.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3.1. Bug Graphs

   If you have installed the necessary Perl modules you can start collecting
   statistics for the nifty Bugzilla graphs.
   bash# crontab -e

   This should bring up the crontab file in your editor. Add a cron entry like
   this to run collectstats.pl daily at 5 after midnight:
   5 0 * * * cd <your-bugzilla-directory> ; ./collectstats.pl

   After two days have passed you'll be able to view bug graphs from the
   Reports page.

   When upgrading Bugzilla, this format may change. To create new status data,
   (re)move old data and run the following commands:
        bash$
        cd <your-bugzilla-directory>
        bash$
        ./collectstats.pl --regenerate

   Note Windows does not have 'cron', but it does have the Task Scheduler,
   which performs the same duties. There are also third-party tools that can be
      used to implement cron, such as nncron.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3.2. Dependency Charts

   As well as the text-based dependency trees, Bugzilla also supports a
   graphical view of dependency relationships, using a package called 'dot'.
   Exactly how this works is controlled by the 'webdotbase' parameter, which
   can have one of three values:

    1. A complete file path to the command 'dot' (part of GraphViz) will
       generate the graphs locally
    2. A URL prefix pointing to an installation of the webdot package will
       generate the graphs remotely
    3. A blank value will disable dependency graphing.

   The easiest way to get this working is to install GraphViz. If you do that,
   you need to enable server-side image maps in Apache. Alternatively, you
   could set up a webdot server, or use the AT&T public webdot server. This is
   the default for the webdotbase param, but it's often overloaded and slow.
   Note that AT&T's server won't work if Bugzilla is only accessible using
   HARTS. Editor's note: What the heck is HARTS? Google doesn't know... 
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3.3. The Whining Cron

   What good are bugs if they're not annoying? To help make them more so you
   can set up Bugzilla's automatic whining system to complain at engineers
   which leave their bugs in the NEW or REOPENED state without triaging them.

   This can be done by adding the following command as a daily crontab entry,
   in the same manner as explained above for bug graphs. This example runs it
   at 12.55am.
   55 0 * * * cd <your-bugzilla-directory> ; ./whineatnews.pl

   Note Windows does not have 'cron', but it does have the Task Scheduler,
   which performs the same duties. There are also third-party tools that can be
      used to implement cron, such as nncron.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3.4. Whining

   As of Bugzilla 2.20, users can configure Bugzilla to regularly annoy them at
   regular intervals, by having Bugzilla execute saved searches at certain
   times and emailing the results to the user. This is known as "Whining". The
   process of configuring Whining is described in Section 5.13, but for it to
   work a Perl script must be executed at regular intervals.

   This can be done by adding the following command as a daily crontab entry,
   in the same manner as explained above for bug graphs. This example runs it
   every 15 minutes.
   */15 * * * * cd <your-bugzilla-directory> ; ./whine.pl

   Note Whines can be executed as often as every 15 minutes, so if you specify
   longer intervals between executions of whine.pl, some users may not be
   whined at as often as they would expect. Depending on the person, this can
      either be a very Good Thing or a very Bad Thing.

   Note Windows does not have 'cron', but it does have the Task Scheduler,
   which performs the same duties. There are also third-party tools that can be
      used to implement cron, such as nncron.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3.5. Patch Viewer

   Patch Viewer is the engine behind Bugzilla's graphical display of code
   patches. You can integrate this with copies of the cvs, lxr and bonsai tools
   if you have them, by giving the locations of your installation of these
   tools in editparams.cgi.

   Patch Viewer also optionally will use the cvs, diff and interdiff
   command-line utilities if they exist on the system. Interdiff can be
   obtained from http://cyberelk.net/tim/patchutils/. If these programs are not
   in the system path, you can configure their locations in localconfig.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3.6. LDAP Authentication

   LDAP authentication is a module for Bugzilla's plugin authentication
   architecture.

   The existing authentication scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses as the
   primary user ID, and a password to authenticate that user. All places within
   Bugzilla where you need to deal with user ID (e.g assigning a bug) use the
   email address. The LDAP authentication builds on top of this scheme, rather
   than replacing it. The initial log in is done with a username and password
   for the LDAP directory. Bugzilla tries to bind to LDAP using those
   credentials, and if successful, try to map this account to a Bugzilla
   account. If a LDAP mail attribute is defined, the value of this attribute is
   used, otherwise emailsuffix parameter is appended to LDAP username to form a
   full email address. If an account for this address already exists in your
   Bugzilla system, it will log in to that account. If no account for that
   email address exists, one is created at the time of login. (In this case,
   Bugzilla will attempt to use the "displayName" or "cn" attribute to
   determine the user's full name.) After authentication, all other
   user-related tasks are still handled by email address, not LDAP username.
   You still assign bugs by email address, query on users by email address,
   etc.

   Caution Because the Bugzilla account is not created until the first time a
   user logs in, a user who has not yet logged is unknown to Bugzilla. This
   means they cannot be used as an assignee or QA contact (default or
   otherwise), added to any cc list, or any other such operation. One possible
   workaround is the bugzilla_ldapsync.rb script in the contrib directory.
      Another possible solution is fixing bug 201069.

   Parameters required to use LDAP Authentication:

   user_verify_class
          This parameter should be set to "LDAP" only if you will be using an
          LDAP directory for authentication. If you set this param to "LDAP"
          but fail to set up the other parameters listed below you will not be
          able to log back in to Bugzilla one you log out. If this happens to
          you, you will need to manually edit data/params and set
          user_verify_class to "DB".

   LDAPserver
          This parameter should be set to the name (and optionally the port) of
          your LDAP server. If no port is specified, it assumes the default
          LDAP port of 389.

          Ex. "ldap.company.com" or "ldap.company.com:3268"

          You can also specify a LDAP URI, so as to use other protocols, such
          as LDAPS or LDAPI. If port was not specified in the URI, the default
          is either 389 or 636 for 'LDAP' and 'LDAPS' schemes respectively.

          Ex. "ldap://ldap.company.com", "ldaps://ldap.company.com" or
          "ldapi://%2fvar%2flib%2fldap_sock"

   LDAPbinddn [Optional]
          Some LDAP servers will not allow an anonymous bind to search the
          directory. If this is the case with your configuration you should set
          the LDAPbinddn parameter to the user account Bugzilla should use
          instead of the anonymous bind.

          Ex. "cn=default,cn=user:password"

   LDAPBaseDN
          The LDAPBaseDN parameter should be set to the location in your LDAP
          tree that you would like to search for email addresses. Your uids
          should be unique under the DN specified here.

          Ex. "ou=People,o=Company"

   LDAPuidattribute
          The LDAPuidattribute parameter should be set to the attribute which
          contains the unique UID of your users. The value retrieved from this
          attribute will be used when attempting to bind as the user to confirm
          their password.

          Ex. "uid"

   LDAPmailattribute
          The LDAPmailattribute parameter should be the name of the attribute
          which contains the email address your users will enter into the
          Bugzilla login boxes.

          Ex. "mail"
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3.7. Serving Alternate Formats with the right MIME type

   Some Bugzilla pages have alternate formats, other than just plain HTML. In
   particular, a few Bugzilla pages can output their contents as either XUL (a
   special Mozilla format, that looks like a program GUI) or RDF (a type of
   structured XML that can be read by various programs).

   In order for your users to see these pages correctly, Apache must send them
   with the right MIME type. To do this, add the following lines to your Apache
   configuration, either in the <VirtualHost> section for your Bugzilla, or in
   the <Directory> section for your Bugzilla:

AddType application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml .xul
AddType application/rdf+xml .rdf
     _________________________________________________________________

2.4. Multiple Bugzilla databases with a single installation

   The previous instructions referred to a standard installation, with one
   unique Bugzilla database. However, you may want to host several distinct
   installations, without having several copies of the code. This is possible
   by using the PROJECT environment variable. When accessed, Bugzilla checks
   for the existence of this variable, and if present, uses its value to check
   for an alternative configuration file named localconfig.<PROJECT> in the
   same location as the default one (localconfig). It also checks for
   customized templates in a directory named <PROJECT> in the same location as
   the default one (template/<langcode>). By default this is
   template/en/default so PROJECT's templates would be located at
   template/en/PROJECT.

   To set up an alternate installation, just export PROJECT=foo before running
   checksetup.pl for the first time. It will result in a file called
   localconfig.foo instead of localconfig. Edit this file as described above,
   with reference to a new database, and re-run checksetup.pl to populate it.
   That's all.

   Now you have to configure the web server to pass this environment variable
   when accessed via an alternate URL, such as virtual host for instance. The
   following is an example of how you could do it in Apache, other Webservers
   may differ.
<VirtualHost 212.85.153.228:80>
    ServerName foo.bar.baz
    SetEnv PROJECT foo
    Alias /bugzilla /var/www/bugzilla
</VirtualHost>

   Don't forget to also export this variable before accessing Bugzilla by other
   means, such as cron tasks for instance.

2.5. OS-Specific Installation Notes

   Many aspects of the Bugzilla installation can be affected by the operating
   system you choose to install it on. Sometimes it can be made easier and
   others more difficult. This section will attempt to help you understand both
   the difficulties of running on specific operating systems and the utilities
   available to make it easier.

   If you have anything to add or notes for an operating system not covered,
   please file a bug in Bugzilla Documentation.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.1. Microsoft Windows

   Making Bugzilla work on Windows is more difficult than making it work on
   Unix. For that reason, we still recommend doing so on a Unix based system
   such as GNU/Linux. That said, if you do want to get Bugzilla running on
   Windows, you will need to make the following adjustments.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.1.1. Win32 Perl

   Perl for Windows can be obtained from ActiveState. You should be able to
   find a compiled binary at
   http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/. The following
   instructions assume that you are using version 5.8.1 of ActiveState.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.1.2. Perl Modules on Win32

   Bugzilla on Windows requires the same perl modules found in Section 2.1.5.
   The main difference is that windows uses PPM instead of CPAN.
C:\perl> ppm install <module name>

   The best source for the Windows PPM modules needed for Bugzilla is probably
   the Bugzilla Test Server (aka 'Landfill'), so you should add the Landfill
   package repository as follows:
ppm repository add landfill http://www.landfill.bugzilla.org/ppm/

   Note The PPM repository stores modules in 'packages' that may have a
   slightly different name than the module. If retrieving these modules from
   there, you will need to pay attention to the information provided when you
      run checksetup.pl as it will tell you what package you'll need to install.

   Tip If you are behind a corporate firewall, you will need to let the
   ActiveState PPM utility know how to get through it to access the
   repositories by setting the HTTP_proxy system environmental variable. For
   more information on setting that variable, see the ActiveState
      documentation.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.1.3. Code changes required to run on Win32

   Bugzilla on Win32 is supported out of the box from version 2.20; this means
   that no code changes are required to get Bugzilla running.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.1.4. Serving the web pages

   As is the case on Unix based systems, any web server should be able to
   handle Bugzilla; however, the Bugzilla Team still recommends Apache whenever
   asked. No matter what web server you choose, be sure to pay attention to the
   security notes in Section 4.3.1. More information on configuring specific
   web servers can be found in Section 2.2.4.

   Note If using Apache on windows, you can set the ScriptInterpreterSource
   directive in your Apache config to avoid having to modify the first line of
      every script to contain your path to perl perl instead of /usr/bin/perl.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.1.5. Sending Email

   To enable Bugzilla to send email on Windows, the server running the Bugzilla
   code must be able to connect to, or act as, an SMTP server.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.2. Mac OS X

   Making Bugzilla work on Mac OS X requires the following adjustments.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.2.1. Sendmail

   In Mac OS X 10.3 and later, Postfix is used as the built-in email server.
   Postfix provides an executable that mimics sendmail enough to fool Bugzilla,
   as long as Bugzilla can find it.

   As of version 2.20, Bugzilla will be able to find the fake sendmail
   executable without any assistance. However, you will have to turn on the
   sendmailnow parameter before you do anything that would result in email
   being sent. For more information, see the description of the sendmailnow
   parameter in Section 3.1.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.2.2. Libraries & Perl Modules on Mac OS X

   Apple did not include the GD library with Mac OS X. Bugzilla needs this for
   bug graphs.

   You can install it using a program called Fink, which is similar in nature
   to the CPAN installer, but installs common GNU utilities. Fink is available
   from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/.

   Follow the instructions for setting up Fink. Once it's installed, you'll
   want to use it to install the gd2 package.

   It will prompt you for a number of dependencies, type 'y' and hit enter to
   install all of the dependencies and then watch it work. You will then be
   able to use CPAN to install the GD Perl module.

   Note To prevent creating conflicts with the software that Apple installs by
   default, Fink creates its own directory tree at /sw where it installs most
   of the software that it installs. This means your libraries and headers will
   be at /sw/lib and /sw/include instead of /usr/lib and /usr/include. When the
   Perl module config script asks where your libgd is, be sure to tell it
      /sw/lib.

   Also available via Fink is expat. After using fink to install the expat
   package you will be able to install XML::Parser using CPAN. There is one
   caveat. Unlike recent versions of the GD module, XML::Parser doesn't prompt
   for the location of the required libraries. When using CPAN, you will need
   to use the following command sequence:
# perl -MCPAN -e'look XML::Parser'         (1)
# perl Makefile.PL EXPATLIBPATH=/sw/lib EXPATINCPATH=/sw/include
# make; make test; make install            (2)
# exit                                     (3)

   (1) (3) 
          The look command will download the module and spawn a new shell with
          the extracted files as the current working directory. The exit
          command will return you to your original shell.
   (2) 
          You should watch the output from these make commands, especially
          "make test" as errors may prevent XML::Parser from functioning
          correctly with Bugzilla.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5.3. Linux-Mandrake 8.0

   Linux-Mandrake 8.0 includes every required and optional library for
   Bugzilla. The easiest way to install them is by using the urpmi utility. If
   you follow these commands, you should have everything you need for Bugzilla,
   and ./checksetup.pl should not complain about any missing libraries. You may
   already have some of these installed.
bash# urpmi perl-mysql
bash# urpmi perl-chart
bash# urpmi perl-gd
bash# urpmi perl-MailTools              (1)
bash# urpmi apache-modules

   (1) 
          for Bugzilla email integration
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6. UNIX (non-root) Installation Notes

2.6.1. Introduction

   If you are running a *NIX OS as non-root, either due to lack of access (web
   hosts, for example) or for security reasons, this will detail how to install
   Bugzilla on such a setup. It is recommended that you read through the
   Section 2.1 first to get an idea on the installation steps required. (These
   notes will reference to steps in that guide.)
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.2. MySQL

   You may have MySQL installed as root. If you're setting up an account with a
   web host, a MySQL account needs to be set up for you. From there, you can
   create the bugs account, or use the account given to you.

   Warning You may have problems trying to set up GRANT permissions to the
   database. If you're using a web host, chances are that you have a separate
   database which is already locked down (or one big database with limited/no
   access to the other areas), but you may want to ask your system
   administrator what the security settings are set to, and/or run the GRANT
   command for you.

   Also, you will probably not be able to change the MySQL root user password
      (for obvious reasons), so skip that step.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.2.1. Running MySQL as Non-Root

2.6.2.1.1. The Custom Configuration Method

   Create a file .my.cnf in your home directory (using /home/foo in this
   example) as follows....
[mysqld]
datadir=/home/foo/mymysql
socket=/home/foo/mymysql/thesock
port=8081

[mysql]
socket=/home/foo/mymysql/thesock
port=8081

[mysql.server]
user=mysql
basedir=/var/lib

[safe_mysqld]
err-log=/home/foo/mymysql/the.log
pid-file=/home/foo/mymysql/the.pid
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.2.1.2. The Custom Built Method

   You can install MySQL as a not-root, if you really need to. Build it with
   PREFIX set to /home/foo/mysql, or use pre-installed executables, specifying
   that you want to put all of the data files in /home/foo/mysql/data. If there
   is another MySQL server running on the system that you do not own, use the
   -P option to specify a TCP port that is not in use.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.2.1.3. Starting the Server

   After your mysqld program is built and any .my.cnf file is in place, you
   must initialize the databases (ONCE).
              bash$
              mysql_install_db

   Then start the daemon with
              bash$
              safe_mysql &

   After you start mysqld the first time, you then connect to it as "root" and
   GRANT permissions to other users. (Again, the MySQL root account has nothing
   to do with the *NIX root account.)

   Note You will need to start the daemons yourself. You can either ask your
   system administrator to add them to system startup files, or add a crontab
   entry that runs a script to check on these daemons and restart them if
      needed.

   Warning Do NOT run daemons or other services on a server without first
   consulting your system administrator! Daemons use up system resources and
   running one may be in violation of your terms of service for any machine on
      which you are a user!
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.3. Perl

   On the extremely rare chance that you don't have Perl on the machine, you
   will have to build the sources yourself. The following commands should get
   your system installed with your own personal version of Perl:
        bash$
        wget http://perl.com/CPAN/src/stable.tar.gz
        bash$
        tar zvxf stable.tar.gz
        bash$
        cd perl-5.8.1 (or whatever the version of Perl is called)
        bash$
        sh Configure -de -Dprefix=/home/foo/perl
        bash$
        make && make test && make install

   Once you have Perl installed into a directory (probably in ~/perl/bin),
   you'll have to change the locations on the scripts, which is detailed later
   on this page.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.4. Perl Modules

   Installing the Perl modules as a non-root user is probably the hardest part
   of the process. There are two different methods: a completely independant
   Perl with its own modules, or personal modules using the current (root
   installed) version of Perl. The independant method takes up quite a bit of
   disk space, but is less complex, while the mixed method only uses as much
   space as the modules themselves, but takes more work to setup.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.4.1. The Independant Method

   The independant method requires that you install your own personal version
   of Perl, as detailed in the previous section. Once installed, you can start
   the CPAN shell with the following command:

            bash$
            /home/foo/perl/bin/perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'

   And then:

            cpan>
            install Bundle::Bugzilla

   With this method, module installation will usually go a lot smoother, but if
   you have any hang-ups, you can consult the next section.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.4.2. The Mixed Method

   First, you'll need to configure CPAN to install modules in your home
   directory. The CPAN FAQ says the following on this issue:

5)  I am not root, how can I install a module in a personal directory?

    You will most probably like something like this:

      o conf makepl_arg "LIB=~/myperl/lib \
                         INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/myperl/man/man1 \
                         INSTALLMAN3DIR=~/myperl/man/man3"
    install Sybase::Sybperl

    You can make this setting permanent like all "o conf" settings with "o conf
 commit".

    You will have to add ~/myperl/man to the MANPATH environment variable and a
lso tell your Perl programs to
    look into ~/myperl/lib, e.g. by including

      use lib "$ENV{HOME}/myperl/lib";

    or setting the PERL5LIB environment variable.

    Another thing you should bear in mind is that the UNINST parameter should n
ever be set if you are not root.

   So, you will need to create a Perl directory in your home directory, as well
   as the lib, man, man/man1, and man/man3 directories in that Perl directory.
   Set the MANPATH variable and PERL5LIB variable, so that the installation of
   the modules goes smoother. (Setting UNINST=0 in your "make install" options,
   on the CPAN first-time configuration, is also a good idea.)

   After that, go into the CPAN shell:

            bash$
            perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'

   From there, you will need to type in the above "o conf" command and commit
   the changes. Then you can run through the installation:

            cpan>
            install Bundle::Bugzilla

   Most of the module installation process should go smoothly. However, you may
   have some problems with Template. When you first start, you will want to try
   to install Template with the XS Stash options on. If this doesn't work, it
   may spit out C compiler error messages and croak back to the CPAN shell
   prompt. So, redo the install, and turn it off. (In fact, say no to all of
   the Template questions.) It may also start failing on a few of the tests. If
   the total tests passed is a reasonable figure (90+%), force the install with
   the following command:

            cpan>
            force install Template

   You may also want to install the other optional modules:
          cpan>
          install GD
          cpan>
          install Chart::Base
          cpan>
          install MIME::Parser
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.5. HTTP Server

   Ideally, this also needs to be installed as root and run under a special
   webserver account. As long as the web server will allow the running of *.cgi
   files outside of a cgi-bin, and a way of denying web access to certain files
   (such as a .htaccess file), you should be good in this department.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.5.1. Running Apache as Non-Root

   You can run Apache as a non-root user, but the port will need to be set to
   one above 1024. If you type httpd -V, you will get a list of the variables
   that your system copy of httpd uses. One of those, namely HTTPD_ROOT, tells
   you where that installation looks for its config information.

   From there, you can copy the config files to your own home directory to
   start editing. When you edit those and then use the -d option to override
   the HTTPD_ROOT compiled into the web server, you get control of your own
   customized web server.

   Note You will need to start the daemons yourself. You can either ask your
   system administrator to add them to system startup files, or add a crontab
   entry that runs a script to check on these daemons and restart them if
      needed.

   Warning Do NOT run daemons or other services on a server without first
   consulting your system administrator! Daemons use up system resources and
   running one may be in violation of your terms of service for any machine on
      which you are a user!
     _________________________________________________________________

2.6.6. Bugzilla

   If you had to install Perl modules as a non-root user (Section 2.6.4) or to
   non-standard directories, you will need to change the scripts, setting the
   correct location of the Perl modules:

perl -pi -e
        's@use strict\;@use strict\; use lib \"/home/foo/perl/lib\"\;@'
        *cgi *pl Bug.pm processmail syncshadowdb

   Change /home/foo/perl/lib to your personal Perl library directory. You can
   probably skip this step if you are using the independant method of Perl
   module installation.

   When you run ./checksetup.pl to create the localconfig file, it will list
   the Perl modules it finds. If one is missing, go back and double-check the
   module installation from the CPAN shell, then delete the localconfig file
   and try again.

   Warning The one option in localconfig you might have problems with is the
   web server group. If you can't successfully browse to the index.cgi (like a
   Forbidden error), you may have to relax your permissions, and blank out the
   web server group. Of course, this may pose as a security risk. Having a
   properly jailed shell and/or limited access to shell accounts may lessen the
      security risk, but use at your own risk.
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Administering Bugzilla

3.1. Bugzilla Configuration

   Bugzilla is configured by changing various parameters, accessed from the
   "Edit parameters" link in the page footer. Here are some of the key
   parameters on that page. You should run down this list and set them
   appropriately after installing Bugzilla.

   maintainer
          The maintainer parameter is the email address of the person
          responsible for maintaining this Bugzilla installation. The address
          need not be that of a valid Bugzilla account.

   urlbase
          This parameter defines the fully qualified domain name and web server
          path to your Bugzilla installation.

          For example, if your Bugzilla query page is
          http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/query.cgi, set your "urlbase" to
          http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/.

   makeproductgroups
          This dictates whether or not to automatically create groups when new
          products are created.

   useentrygroupdefault
          Bugzilla products can have a group associated with them, so that
          certain users can only see bugs in certain products. When this
          parameter is set to "on", this causes the initial group controls on
          newly created products to place all newly-created bugs in the group
          having the same name as the product immediately. After a product is
          initially created, the group controls can be further adjusted without
          interference by this mechanism.

   mail_delivery_method
          This is used to specify how email is sent, or if it is sent at all.
          There are several options included for different MTAs, along with two
          additional options that disable email sending. "testfile" does not
          send mail, but instead saves it in data/mailer.testfile for later
          review. "none" disables email sending entirely.

   shadowdb
          You run into an interesting problem when Bugzilla reaches a high
          level of continuous activity. MySQL supports only table-level write
          locking. What this means is that if someone needs to make a change to
          a bug, they will lock the entire table until the operation is
          complete. Locking for write also blocks reads until the write is
          complete. Note that more recent versions of mysql support row level
          locking using different table types. These types are slower than the
          standard type, and Bugzilla does not yet take advantage of features
          such as transactions which would justify this speed decrease. The
          Bugzilla team are, however, happy to hear about any experiences with
          row level locking and Bugzilla.

          The "shadowdb" parameter was designed to get around this limitation.
          While only a single user is allowed to write to a table at a time,
          reads can continue unimpeded on a read-only shadow copy of the
          database. Although your database size will double, a shadow database
          can cause an enormous performance improvement when implemented on
          extremely high-traffic Bugzilla databases.

          As a guide, on reasonably old hardware, mozilla.org began needing
          "shadowdb" when they reached around 40,000 Bugzilla users with
          several hundred Bugzilla bug changes and comments per day.

          The value of the parameter defines the name of the shadow bug
          database. You will need to set the host and port settings from the
          params page, and set up replication in your database server so that
          updates reach this readonly mirror. Consult your database
          documentation for more detail.

   shutdownhtml
          If you need to shut down Bugzilla to perform administration, enter
          some descriptive text (with embedded HTML codes, if you'd like) into
          this box. Anyone who tries to use Bugzilla (including admins) will
          receive a page displaying this text. Users can neither log in nor log
          out while shutdownhtml is enabled.

    Note Although regular log-in capability is disabled while 'shutdownhtml' is
   enabled, safeguards are in place to protect the unfortunate admin who loses
   connection to Bugzilla. Should this happen to you, go directly to the
   editparams.cgi (by typing the URL in manually, if necessary). Doing this
   will prompt you to log in, and your name/password will be accepted here (but
      nowhere else).

   movebugs
          This option is an undocumented feature to allow moving bugs between
          separate Bugzilla installations. You will need to understand the
          source code in order to use this feature. Please consult movebugs.pl
          in your Bugzilla source tree for further documentation, such as it
          is.

   useqacontact
          This allows you to define an email address for each component, in
          addition to that of the default assignee, who will be sent carbon
          copies of incoming bugs.

   globalwatcher
          This allows to define specific users that will receive notification
          each time a new bug in entered, or when an existing bug changes,
          according to the normal groupset permissions. It may be useful for
          sending notifications to a mailing-list, for instance.

   usestatuswhiteboard
          This defines whether you wish to have a free-form, overwritable field
          associated with each bug. The advantage of the Status Whiteboard is
          that it can be deleted or modified with ease, and provides an
          easily-searchable field for indexing some bugs that have some trait
          in common.

   whinedays
          Set this to the number of days you want to let bugs go in the NEW or
          REOPENED state before notifying people they have untouched new bugs.
          If you do not plan to use this feature, simply do not set up the
          whining cron job described in the installation instructions, or set
          this value to "0" (never whine).

   commenton*
          All these fields allow you to dictate what changes can pass without
          comment, and which must have a comment from the person who changed
          them. Often, administrators will allow users to add themselves to the
          CC list, accept bugs, or change the Status Whiteboard without adding
          a comment as to their reasons for the change, yet require that most
          other changes come with an explanation.

          Set the "commenton" options according to your site policy. It is a
          wise idea to require comments when users resolve, reassign, or reopen
          bugs at the very least.

          Note It is generally far better to require a developer comment when
   resolving bugs than not. Few things are more annoying to bug database users
   than having a developer mark a bug "fixed" without any comment as to what
      the fix was (or even that it was truly fixed!)

   supportwatchers
          Turning on this option allows users to ask to receive copies of bug
          mail sent to another user. Watching a user with different group
          permissions is not a way to 'get around' the system; copied emails
          are still subject to the normal groupset permissions of a bug, and
          "watchers" will only be copied on emails from bugs they would
          normally be allowed to view.

   noresolveonopenblockers
          This option will prevent users from resolving bugs as FIXED if they
          have unresolved dependencies. Only the FIXED resolution is affected.
          Users will be still able to resolve bugs to resolutions other than
          FIXED if they have unresolved dependent bugs.

   sendmailnow
          When Bugzilla is using Sendmail older than 8.12, turning this option
          off will improve performance by not waiting for Sendmail to actually
          send mail. If Sendmail 8.12 or later is being used, there is nothing
          to gain by turning this off. If another MTA is being used, such as
          Postfix, then this option *must* be turned on (even if you are using
          the fake sendmail executable that Postfix provides).
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2. User Administration

3.2.1. Creating the Default User

   When you first run checksetup.pl after installing Bugzilla, it will prompt
   you for the administrative username (email address) and password for this
   "super user". If for some reason you delete the "super user" account,
   re-running checksetup.pl will again prompt you for this username and
   password.

   Tip If you wish to add more administrative users, add them to the "admin"
   group and, optionally, edit the tweakparams, editusers, creategroups,
   editcomponents, and editkeywords groups to add the entire admin group to
      those groups (which is the case by default).
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.2. Managing Other Users

3.2.2.1. Searching for existing users

   If you have "editusers" privileges or if you are allowed to grant privileges
   for some groups, the "Users" link appears in the footer.

   The first screen you get is a search form to search for existing user
   accounts. You can run searches based either on the ID, real name or login
   name (i.e. the email address in most cases) of users. You can search in
   different ways the listbox to the right of the text entry box. You can match
   by case-insensitive substring (the default), regular expression, a reverse
   regular expression match, which finds every user name which does NOT match
   the regular expression, or the exact string if you know exactly who you are
   looking for.

   You can also restrict your search to users being in some specific group. By
   default, the restriction is turned off. Then you get a list of users
   matching your criteria, and clicking their login name lets you edit their
   properties.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.2.2. Creating new users

3.2.2.2.1. Self-registration

   By default, users can create their own user accounts by clicking the "New
   Account" link at the bottom of each page (assuming they aren't logged in as
   someone else already). If you want to disable this self-registration, or if
   you want to restrict who can create his own user account, you have to edit
   the "createemailregexp" parameter in the "Configuration" page, see Section
   3.1.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.2.2.2. Accounts created by an administrator

   Users with "editusers" privileges, such as administrators, can create user
   accounts for other users:

    1. After logging in, click the "Users" link at the footer of the query
       page, and then click "Add a new user".
    2. Fill out the form presented. This page is self-explanatory. When done,
       click "Submit".

     Note Adding a user this way will not send an email informing them of their
   username and password. While useful for creating dummy accounts (watchers
   which shuttle mail to another system, for instance, or email addresses which
   are a mailing list), in general it is preferable to log out and use the "New
   Account" button to create users, as it will pre-populate all the required
      fields and also notify the user of her account name and password.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.2.3. Modifying Users

   Once you have found your user, you can change the following fields:

     * Login Name: This is generally the user's full email address. However, if
       you have are using the "emailsuffix" parameter, this may just be the
       user's login name. Note that users can now change their login names
       themselves (to any valid email address).
     * Real Name: The user's real name. Note that Bugzilla does not require
       this to create an account.
     * Password: You can change the user's password here. Users can
       automatically request a new password, so you shouldn't need to do this
       often. If you want to disable an account, see Disable Text below.
     * Bugmail Disabled: Mark this checkbox to disable bugmail and whinemail
       completely for this account. This checkbox replaces the data/nomail file
       which existed in older versions of Bugzilla.
     * Disable Text: If you type anything in this box, including just a space,
       the user is prevented from logging in, or making any changes to bugs via
       the web interface. The HTML you type in this box is presented to the
       user when they attempt to perform these actions, and should explain why
       the account was disabled.
       Users with disabled accounts will continue to receive mail from
       Bugzilla; furthermore, they will not be able to log in themselves to
       change their own preferences and stop it. If you want an account
       (disabled or active) to stop receiving mail, simply check the "Bugmail
       Disabled" checkbox above.

    Note Even users whose accounts have been disabled can still submit bugs via
   the e-mail gateway, if one exists. The e-mail gateway should not be enabled
      for secure installations of Bugzilla.

       Warning Don't disable all the administrator accounts!
     * <groupname>: If you have created some groups, e.g. "securitysensitive",
       then checkboxes will appear here to allow you to add users to, or remove
       them from, these groups.
     * canconfirm: This field is only used if you have enabled the
       "unconfirmed" status. If you enable this for a user, that user can then
       move bugs from "Unconfirmed" to a "Confirmed" status (e.g.: "New"
       status).
     * creategroups: This option will allow a user to create and destroy groups
       in Bugzilla.
     * editbugs: Unless a user has this bit set, they can only edit those bugs
       for which they are the assignee or the reporter. Even if this option is
       unchecked, users can still add comments to bugs.
     * editcomponents: This flag allows a user to create new products and
       components, as well as modify and destroy those that have no bugs
       associated with them. If a product or component has bugs associated with
       it, those bugs must be moved to a different product or component before
       Bugzilla will allow them to be destroyed.
     * editkeywords: If you use Bugzilla's keyword functionality, enabling this
       feature allows a user to create and destroy keywords. As always, the
       keywords for existing bugs containing the keyword the user wishes to
       destroy must be changed before Bugzilla will allow it to die.
     * editusers: This flag allows a user to do what you're doing right now:
       edit other users. This will allow those with the right to do so to
       remove administrator privileges from other users or grant them to
       themselves. Enable with care.
     * tweakparams: This flag allows a user to change Bugzilla's Params (using
       editparams.cgi.)
     * <productname>: This allows an administrator to specify the products in
       which a user can see bugs. The user must still have the "editbugs"
       privilege to edit bugs in these products.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.2.4. Deleting Users

   If the "allowuserdeletion" parameter is turned on, see Section 3.1, then you
   can also delete user accounts. Note that this is most of the time not the
   best thing to do. If only a warning in a yellow box is displayed, then the
   deletion is safe. If a warning is also displayed in a red box, then you
   should NOT try to delete the user account, else you will get referential
   integrity problems in your database, which can lead to unexpected behavior,
   such as bugs not appearing in bug lists anymore, or data displaying
   incorrectly. You have been warned!
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.2.5. Impersonating Users

   There may be times when an administrator would like to do something as
   another user. The sudo feature may be used to do this.

   Note To use the sudo feature, you must be in the bz_sudoers group. By
      default, all administrators are in this group.

   If you have access to this feature, you may start a session by going to the
   Edit Users page, Searching for a user and clicking on their login. You
   should see a link below their login name titled "Impersonate this user".
   Click on the link. This will take you to a page where you will see a
   description of the feature and instructions for using it. After reading the
   text, simply enter the login of the user you would like to impersonate,
   provide a short message explaining why you are doing this, and press the
   button.

   As long as you are using this feature, everything you do will be done as if
   you were logged in as the user you are impersonating.

   Warning The user you are impersonating will not be told about what you are
   doing. If you do anything that results in mail being sent, that mail will
   appear to be from the user you are impersonating. You should be extremely
      careful while using this feature.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3. Classifications

   Classifications tend to be used in order to group several related products
   into one distinct entity.

   The classifications layer is disabled by default; it can be turned on or off
   using the useclassification parameter, in the Bug Fields section of the edit
   parameters screen.

   Access to the administration of classifications is controlled using the
   editclassifications system group, which defines a privilege for creating,
   destroying, and editing classifications.

   When activated, classifications will introduce an additional step when
   filling bugs (dedicated to classification selection), and they will also
   appear in the advanced search form.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.4. Products

   Products tend to represent real-world shipping products. E.g. if your
   company makes computer games, you should have one product per game, perhaps
   a "Common" product for units of technology used in multiple games, and maybe
   a few special products (Website, Administration...)

   Many of Bugzilla's settings are configurable on a per-product basis. The
   number of "votes" available to users is set per-product, as is the number of
   votes required to move a bug automatically from the UNCONFIRMED status to
   the NEW status.

   To create a new product:

    1. Select "products" from the footer
    2. Select the "Add" link in the bottom right
    3. Enter the name of the product and a description. The Description field
       may contain HTML.

   Don't worry about the "Closed for bug entry", "Maximum Votes per person",
   "Maximum votes a person can put on a single bug", "Number of votes a bug in
   this Product needs to automatically get out of the UNCONFIRMED state", and
   "Version" options yet. We'll cover those in a few moments.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.5. Components

   Components are subsections of a Product. E.g. the computer game you are
   designing may have a "UI" component, an "API" component, a "Sound System"
   component, and a "Plugins" component, each overseen by a different
   programmer. It often makes sense to divide Components in Bugzilla according
   to the natural divisions of responsibility within your Product or company.

   Each component has a default assignee and (if you turned it on in the
   parameters), a QA Contact. The default assignee should be the primary person
   who fixes bugs in that component. The QA Contact should be the person who
   will ensure these bugs are completely fixed. The Assignee, QA Contact, and
   Reporter will get email when new bugs are created in this Component and when
   these bugs change. Default Assignee and Default QA Contact fields only
   dictate the default assignments; these can be changed on bug submission, or
   at any later point in a bug's life.

   To create a new Component:

    1. Select the "Edit components" link from the "Edit product" page
    2. Select the "Add" link in the bottom right.
    3. Fill out the "Component" field, a short "Description", the "Default
       Assignee" and "Default QA Contact" (if enabled). The Component and
       Description fields may contain HTML; the "Default Assignee" field must
       be a login name already existing in the database.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.6. Versions

   Versions are the revisions of the product, such as "Flinders 3.1", "Flinders
   95", and "Flinders 2000". Version is not a multi-select field; the usual
   practice is to select the earliest version known to have the bug.

   To create and edit Versions:

    1. From the "Edit product" screen, select "Edit Versions"
    2. You will notice that the product already has the default version
       "undefined". Click the "Add" link in the bottom right.
    3. Enter the name of the Version. This field takes text only. Then click
       the "Add" button.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.7. Milestones

   Milestones are "targets" that you plan to get a bug fixed by. For example,
   you have a bug that you plan to fix for your 3.0 release, it would be
   assigned the milestone of 3.0.

   Note Milestone options will only appear for a Product if you turned on the
      "usetargetmilestone" Param in the "Edit Parameters" screen.

   To create new Milestones, set Default Milestones, and set Milestone URL:

    1. Select "Edit milestones" from the "Edit product" page.
    2. Select "Add" in the bottom right corner. text
    3. Enter the name of the Milestone in the "Milestone" field. You can
       optionally set the "sortkey", which is a positive or negative number
       (-32768 to 32767) that defines where in the list this particular
       milestone appears. This is because milestones often do not occur in
       alphanumeric order For example, "Future" might be after "Release 1.2".
       Select "Add".
    4. From the Edit product screen, you can enter the URL of a page which
       gives information about your milestones and what they mean.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8. Flags

   Flags are a way to attach a specific status to a bug or attachment, either
   "+" or "-". The meaning of these symbols depends on the text the flag
   itself, but contextually they could mean pass/fail, accept/reject,
   approved/denied, or even a simple yes/no. If your site allows requestable
   flags, then users may set a flag to "?" as a request to another user that
   they look at the bug/attachment, and set the flag to its correct status.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.1. A Simple Example

   A developer might want to ask their manager, "Should we fix this bug before
   we release version 2.0?" They might want to do this for a lot of bugs, so it
   would be nice to streamline the process...

   In Bugzilla, it would work this way:

    1. The Bugzilla administrator creates a flag type called "blocking2.0" that
       shows up on all bugs in your product.
       It shows up on the "Show Bug" screen as the text "blocking2.0" with a
       drop-down box next to it. The drop-down box contains four values: an
       empty space, "?", "-", and "+".
    2. The developer sets the flag to "?".
    3. The manager sees the blocking2.0 flag with a "?" value.
    4. If the manager thinks the feature should go into the product before
       version 2.0 can be released, he sets the flag to "+". Otherwise, he sets
       it to "-".
    5. Now, every Bugzilla user who looks at the bug knows whether or not the
       bug needs to be fixed before release of version 2.0.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.2. About Flags

3.8.2.1. Values

   Flags can have three values:

   ?
          A user is requesting that a status be set. (Think of it as 'A
          question is being asked'.)

   -
          The status has been set negatively. (The question has been answered
          "no".)

   +
          The status has been set positively. (The question has been answered
          "yes".)

   Actually, there's a fourth value a flag can have -- "unset" -- which shows
   up as a blank space. This just means that nobody has expressed an opinion
   (or asked someone else to express an opinion) about this bug or attachment.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.3. Using flag requests

   If a flag has been defined as 'requestable', and a user has enough
   privileges to request it (see below), the user can set the flag's status to
   "?". This status indicates that someone (a.k.a. "the requester") is asking
   someone else to set the flag to either "+" or "-".

   If a flag has been defined as 'specifically requestable', a text box will
   appear next to the flag into which the requester may enter a Bugzilla
   username. That named person (a.k.a. "the requestee") will receive an email
   notifying them of the request, and pointing them to the bug/attachment in
   question.

   If a flag has not been defined as 'specifically requestable', then no such
   text-box will appear. A request to set this flag cannot be made of any
   specific individual, but must be asked "to the wind". A requester may "ask
   the wind" on any flag simply by leaving the text-box blank.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.4. Two Types of Flags

   Flags can go in two places: on an attachment, or on a bug.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.4.1. Attachment Flags

   Attachment flags are used to ask a question about a specific attachment on a
   bug.

   Many Bugzilla installations use this to request that one developer "review"
   another developer's code before they check it in. They attach the code to a
   bug report, and then set a flag on that attachment called "review" to
   review?boss@domain.com. boss@domain.com is then notified by email that he
   has to check out that attachment and approve it or deny it.

   For a Bugzilla user, attachment flags show up in three places:

    1. On the list of attachments in the "Show Bug" screen, you can see the
       current state of any flags that have been set to ?, +, or -. You can see
       who asked about the flag (the requester), and who is being asked (the
       requestee).
    2. When you "Edit" an attachment, you can see any settable flag, along with
       any flags that have already been set. This "Edit Attachment" screen is
       where you set flags to ?, -, +, or unset them.
    3. Requests are listed in the "Request Queue", which is accessible from the
       "My Requests" link (if you are logged in) or "Requests" link (if you are
       logged out) visible in the footer of all pages.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.4.2. Bug Flags

   Bug flags are used to set a status on the bug itself. You can see Bug Flags
   in the "Show Bug" and "Requests" screens, as described above.

   Only users with enough privileges (see below) may set flags on bugs. This
   doesn't necessarily include the assignee, reporter, or users with the
   editbugs permission.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5. Administering Flags

   If you have the "editcomponents" permission, you will have "Edit: ... |
   Flags | ..." in your page footer. Clicking on that link will bring you to
   the "Administer Flag Types" page. Here, you can select whether you want to
   create (or edit) a Bug flag, or an Attachment flag.

   No matter which you choose, the interface is the same, so we'll just go over
   it once.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1. Creating a Flag

   When you click on the "Create a Flag Type for..." link, you will be
   presented with a form. Here is what the fields in the form mean:
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.1. Name

   This is the name of the flag. This will be displayed to Bugzilla users who
   are looking at or setting the flag. The name may contain any valid Unicode
   characters except commas and spaces.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.2. Description

   The description describes the flag in more detail. It is visible in a
   tooltip when hovering over a flag either in the "Show Bug" or "Edit
   Attachment" pages. This field can be as long as you like, and can contain
   any character you want.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.3. Category

   Default behaviour for a newly-created flag is to appear on products and all
   components, which is why "__Any__:__Any__" is already entered in the
   "Inclusions" box. If this is not your desired behaviour, you must either set
   some exclusions (for products on which you don't want the flag to appear),
   or you must remove "__Any__:__Any__" from the Inclusions box and define
   products/components specifically for this flag.

   To create an Inclusion, select a Product from the top drop-down box. You may
   also select a specific component from the bottom drop-down box. (Setting
   "__Any__" for Product translates to, "all the products in this Bugzilla".
   Selecting "__Any__" in the Component field means "all components in the
   selected product.") Selections made, press "Include", and your
   Product/Component pairing will show up in the "Inclusions" box on the right.

   To create an Exclusion, the process is the same; select a Product from the
   top drop-down box, select a specific component if you want one, and press
   "Exclude". The Product/Component pairing will show up in the "Exclusions"
   box on the right.

   This flag will and can be set for any products/components that appearing in
   the "Inclusions" box (or which fall under the appropriate "__Any__"). This
   flag will not appear (and therefore cannot be set) on any products appearing
   in the "Exclusions" box. IMPORTANT: Exclusions override inclusions.

   You may select a Product without selecting a specific Component, but you
   can't select a Component without a Product, or to select a Component that
   does not belong to the named Product. If you do so, Bugzilla will display an
   error message, even if all your products have a component by that name.

   Example: Let's say you have a product called "Jet Plane" that has thousands
   of components. You want to be able to ask if a problem should be fixed in
   the next model of plane you release. We'll call the flag "fixInNext". But,
   there's one component in "Jet Plane," called "Pilot." It doesn't make sense
   to release a new pilot, so you don't want to have the flag show up in that
   component. So, you include "Jet Plane:__Any__" and you exclude "Jet
   Plane:Pilot".
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.4. Sort Key

   Flags normally show up in alphabetical order. If you want them to show up in
   a different order, you can use this key set the order on each flag. Flags
   with a lower sort key will appear before flags with a higher sort key. Flags
   that have the same sort key will be sorted alphabetically, but they will
   still be after flags with a lower sort key, and before flags with a higher
   sort key.

   Example: I have AFlag (Sort Key 100), BFlag (Sort Key 10), CFlag (Sort Key
   10), and DFlag (Sort Key 1). These show up in the order: DFlag, BFlag,
   CFlag, AFlag.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.5. Active

   Sometimes, you might want to keep old flag information in the Bugzilla
   database, but stop users from setting any new flags of this type. To do
   this, uncheck "active". Deactivated flags will still show up in the UI if
   they are ?, +, or -, but they may only be cleared (unset), and cannot be
   changed to a new value. Once a deactivated flag is cleared, it will
   completely disappear from a bug/attachment, and cannot be set again.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.6. Requestable

   New flags are, by default, "requestable", meaning that they offer users the
   "?" option, as well as "+" and "-". To remove the ? option, uncheck
   "requestable".
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.7. Specifically Requestable

   By default this box is checked for new flags, meaning that users may make
   flag requests of specific individuals. Unchecking this box will remove the
   text box next to a flag; if it is still requestable, then requests may only
   be made "to the wind." Removing this after specific requests have been made
   will not remove those requests; that data will stay in the database (though
   it will no longer appear to the user).
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.8. Multiplicable

   Any flag with "Multiplicable" set (default for new flags is 'on') may be set
   more than once. After being set once, an unset flag of the same type will
   appear below it with "addl." (short for "additional") before the name. There
   is no limit to the number of times a Multiplicable flags may be set on the
   same bug/attachment.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.9. CC List

   If you want certain users to be notified every time this flag is set to ?,
   -, +, or unset, add them here. This is a comma-separated list of email
   addresses that need not be restricted to Bugzilla usernames.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.10. Grant Group

   When this field is set to some given group, only users in the group can set
   the flag to "+" and "-". This field does not affect who can request or
   cancel the flag. For that, see the "Request Group" field below. If this
   field is left blank, all users can set or delete this flag. This field is
   useful for restricting which users can approve or reject requests.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.1.11. Request Group

   When this field is set to some given group, only users in the group can
   request or cancel this flag. Note that this field has no effect if the
   "grant group" field is empty. You can set the value of this field to a
   different group, but both fields have to be set to a group for this field to
   have an effect.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.2. Deleting a Flag

   When you are at the "Administer Flag Types" screen, you will be presented
   with a list of Bug flags and a list of Attachment Flags.

   To delete a flag, click on the "Delete" link next to the flag description.

   Warning Once you delete a flag, it is gone from your Bugzilla. All the data
   for that flag will be deleted. Everywhere that flag was set, it will
   disappear, and you cannot get that data back. If you want to keep flag data,
   but don't want anybody to set any new flags or change current flags, unset
      "active" in the flag Edit form.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.8.5.3. Editing a Flag

   To edit a flag's properties, just click on the "Edit" link next to the
   flag's description. That will take you to the same form described in the
   "Creating a Flag" section.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.9. Custom Fields

   One of the most requested features was the ability to add your own custom
   fields to bugs, based on your needs. With the release of Bugzilla 3.0, this
   dream finally comes true. Administrators can manage these fields using the
   "Custom Fields" link in the footer of pages. The first thing they will see
   is the list of existing custom fields (which is empty by default).
     _________________________________________________________________

3.9.1. Adding Custom Fields

   The "Add a new custom field" link permits you to add a new field which can
   be either a free text box or a drop down menu. More field types will be
   available in future releases.

   The following attributes must be set for each new custom field:

     * Name: the name of the field, used internally. This name MUST begin with
       "cf_". If you omit this string, it will be automatically added to the
       name you entered. This way, all custom fields added to Bugzilla begin
       with "cf_", avoiding any conflict with default fields.
     * Description: the string which is used as a label for this custom field.
       That is the string that users will see, and so should be short and
       explicit.
     * Type: as mentioned above, only two types are implemented so far. Free
       text boxes let you type any string, while drop down menus only let you
       choose one value in the list provided. The list of legal values for this
       field can be created and edited as soon as this custom field is added to
       the DB. See Section 3.10.1 for information about editing legal values.
     * Sortkey: this integer determines in which order custom fields are
       displayed in the UI, especially when viewing a bug. Fields with lower
       values are displayed first.
     * Can be set on bug creation: this boolean determines whether this field
       can be set on bug creation or not. If not, then you have to create the
       bug first before being able to set this field. Else you can set its
       value at the same time you file a bug, see Section 5.6 about filing
       bugs.
     * Displayed in bugmail for new bugs: this boolean determines whether the
       value set on this field should appear in bugmail when the bug is filed.
       This attribute has no effect if the field cannot be set on bug creation.
     * Is obsolete: this boolean determines whether or not this field should be
       displayed at all. Obsolete custom fields are hidden.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.9.2. Editing Custom Fields

   As soon as a custom field is created, its name and type cannot be changed.
   If this field is a drop down menu, its legal values can be set as described
   in Section 3.10.1. All other attributes can be edited as described above.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.9.3. Deleting Custom Fields

   At this point, it is not possible to delete custom fields from your web
   browser. If you don't want to make one available anymore, mark it as
   obsolete. This way, you will preserve your DB referential integrity.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.10. Legal Values

   Since Bugzilla 2.20 RC1, legal values for Operating Systems, platforms, bug
   priorities and severities can be edited from the User Interface directly.
   This means that it is no longer required to manually edit localconfig.
   Starting with Bugzilla 2.23.3, you can also customize the list of valid
   resolutions from the same interface.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.10.1. Viewing/Editing legal values

   Editing legal values requires "admin" privileges. A link named "Field
   Values" is visible in your footer and clicking on it displays the list of
   fields whose values can be edited.

   You can add as many legal values as you want, and each value must be unique
   (on a per field basis). The sortkey is important to display these values in
   the desired order.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.10.2. Deleting legal values

   You can also delete legal values, but only if the two following conditions
   are respected:

    1. The value is not used by default for the field.
    2. No bug is currently using this value.

   If any of these conditions is not respected, the value cannot be deleted.
   The only way to delete these values is to reassign bugs to another value and
   to set another value as default for the field.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.11. Voting

   Voting allows users to be given a pot of votes which they can allocate to
   bugs, to indicate that they'd like them fixed. This allows developers to
   gauge user need for a particular enhancement or bugfix. By allowing bugs
   with a certain number of votes to automatically move from "UNCONFIRMED" to
   "NEW", users of the bug system can help high-priority bugs garner attention
   so they don't sit for a long time awaiting triage.

   To modify Voting settings:

    1. Navigate to the "Edit product" screen for the Product you wish to modify
    2. Maximum Votes per person: Setting this field to "0" disables voting.
    3. Maximum Votes a person can put on a single bug: It should probably be
       some number lower than the "Maximum votes per person". Don't set this
       field to "0" if "Maximum votes per person" is non-zero; that doesn't
       make any sense.
    4. Number of votes a bug in this product needs to automatically get out of
       the UNCONFIRMED state: Setting this field to "0" disables the automatic
       move of bugs from UNCONFIRMED to NEW.
    5. Once you have adjusted the values to your preference, click "Update".
     _________________________________________________________________

3.12. Quips

   Quips are small text messages that can be configured to appear next to
   search results. A Bugzilla installation can have its own specific quips.
   Whenever a quip needs to be displayed, a random selection is made from the
   pool of already existing quips.

   Quips are controlled by the enablequips parameter. It has several possible
   values: on, approved, frozen or off. In order to enable quips approval you
   need to set this parameter to "approved". In this way, users are free to
   submit quips for addition but an administrator must explicitly approve them
   before they are actually used.

   In order to see the user interface for the quips, it is enough to click on a
   quip when it is displayed together with the search results. Or it can be
   seen directly in the browser by visiting the quips.cgi URL (prefixed with
   the usual web location of the Bugzilla installation). Once the quip
   interface is displayed, it is enough to click the "view and edit the whole
   quip list" in order to see the administration page. A page with all the
   quips available in the database will be displayed.

   Next to each tip there is a checkbox, under the "Approved" column. Quips who
   have this checkbox checked are already approved and will appear next to the
   search results. The ones that have it unchecked are still preserved in the
   database but they will not appear on search results pages. User submitted
   quips have initially the checkbox unchecked.

   Also, there is a delete link next to each quip, which can be used in order
   to permanently delete a quip.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.13. Groups and Group Security

   Groups allow the administrator to isolate bugs or products that should only
   be seen by certain people. The association between products and groups is
   controlled from the product edit page under "Edit Group Controls."

   If the makeproductgroups param is on, a new group will be automatically
   created for every new product. It is primarily available for backward
   compatibility with older sites.

   Note that group permissions are such that you need to be a member of all the
   groups a bug is in, for whatever reason, to see that bug. Similarly, you
   must be a member of all of the entry groups for a product to add bugs to a
   product and you must be a member of all of the canedit groups for a product
   in order to make any change to bugs in that product.

   Note By default, bugs can also be seen by the Assignee, the Reporter, and by
   everyone on the CC List, regardless of whether or not the bug would
   typically be viewable by them. Visibility to the Reporter and CC List can be
   overridden (on a per-bug basis) by bringing up the bug, finding the section
   that starts with "Users in the roles selected below..." and un-checking the
      box next to either 'Reporter' or 'CC List' (or both).
     _________________________________________________________________

3.13.1. Creating Groups

   To create Groups:

    1. Select the "groups" link in the footer.
    2. Take a moment to understand the instructions on the "Edit Groups"
       screen, then select the "Add Group" link.
    3. Fill out the "Group", "Description", and "User RegExp" fields. "User
       RegExp" allows you to automatically place all users who fulfill the
       Regular Expression into the new group. When you have finished, click
       "Add".
       Users whose email addresses match the regular expression will
       automatically be members of the group as long as their email addresses
       continue to match the regular expression.

     Note This is a change from 2.16 where the regular expression resulted in a
   user acquiring permanent membership in a group. To remove a user from a
   group the user was in due to a regular expression in version 2.16 or
   earlier, the user must be explicitly removed from the group. This can easily
   be done by pressing buttons named 'Remove Memberships' or 'Remove
      Memberships included in regular expression' under the table.

     Warning If specifying a domain in the regexp, make sure you end the regexp
   with a $. Otherwise, when granting access to "@mycompany\.com", you will
   allow access to 'badperson@mycompany.com.cracker.net'. You need to use
      '@mycompany\.com$' as the regexp.
    4. If you plan to use this group to directly control access to bugs, check
       the "use for bugs" box. Groups not used for bugs are still useful
       because other groups can include the group as a whole.
    5. After you add your new group, edit the new group. On the edit page, you
       can specify other groups that should be included in this group and which
       groups should be permitted to add and delete users from this group.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.13.2. Assigning Users to Groups

   Users can become a member of a group in several ways.

    1. The user can be explicitly placed in the group by editing the user's own
       profile
    2. The group can include another group of which the user is a member.
    3. The user's email address can match a regular expression that the group
       specifies to automatically grant membership to the group.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.13.3. Assigning Group Controls to Products

   On the product edit page, there is a page to edit the "Group Controls" for a
   product. This allows you to configure how a group relates to the product.
   Groups may be applicable, default, and mandatory as well as used to control
   entry or used to make bugs in the product totally read-only unless the group
   restrictions are met.

   For each group, it is possible to specify if membership in that group is...

    1. required for bug entry,
    2. Not applicable to this product(NA), a possible restriction for a member
       of the group to place on a bug in this product(Shown), a default
       restriction for a member of the group to place on a bug in this
       product(Default), or a mandatory restriction to be placed on bugs in
       this product(Mandatory).
    3. Not applicable by non-members to this product(NA), a possible
       restriction for a non-member of the group to place on a bug in this
       product(Shown), a default restriction for a non-member of the group to
       place on a bug in this product(Default), or a mandatory restriction to
       be placed on bugs in this product when entered by a
       non-member(Mandatory).
    4. required in order to make any change to bugs in this product including
       comments.

   These controls are often described in this order, so a product that requires
   a user to be a member of group "foo" to enter a bug and then requires that
   the bug stay restricted to group "foo" at all times and that only members of
   group "foo" can edit the bug even if they otherwise could see the bug would
   have its controls summarized by...

foo: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY, CANEDIT
     _________________________________________________________________

3.13.4. Common Applications of Group Controls

3.13.4.1. General User Access With Security Group

   To permit any user to file bugs in each product (A, B, C...) and to permit
   any user to submit those bugs into a security group....

Product A...
security: SHOWN/SHOWN
Product B...
security: SHOWN/SHOWN
Product C...
security: SHOWN/SHOWN
     _________________________________________________________________

3.13.4.2. General User Access With A Security Product

   To permit any user to file bugs in a Security product while keeping those
   bugs from becoming visible to anyone outside the securityworkers group
   unless a member of the securityworkers group removes that restriction....

Product Security...
securityworkers: DEFAULT/MANDATORY
     _________________________________________________________________

3.13.4.3. Product Isolation With Common Group

   To permit users of product A to access the bugs for product A, users of
   product B to access product B, and support staff to access both, 3 groups
   are needed

    1. Support: Contains members of the support staff.
    2. AccessA: Contains users of product A and the Support group.
    3. AccessB: Contains users of product B and the Support group.

   Once these 3 groups are defined, the products group controls can be set to..
Product A...
AccessA: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Product B...
AccessB: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY

   Optionally, the support group could be permitted to make bugs inaccessible
   to the users and could be permitted to publish bugs relevant to all users in
   a common product that is read-only to anyone outside the support group. That
   configuration could be...
Product A...
AccessA: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Support: SHOWN/NA
Product B...
AccessB: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Support: SHOWN/NA
Product Common...
Support: ENTRY, DEFAULT/MANDATORY, CANEDIT
     _________________________________________________________________

3.14. Upgrading to New Releases

   Upgrading Bugzilla is something we all want to do from time to time, be it
   to get new features or pick up the latest security fix. How easy it is to
   update depends on a few factors:

     * If the new version is a revision or a new point release
     * How many local changes (if any) have been made
     _________________________________________________________________

3.14.1. Version Definitions

   Bugzilla displays the version you are using at the top of the home page
   index.cgi. It looks something like '2.20.3', '2.22.1' or '3.0rc1'. The first
   number in this series is the Major Version. This does not change very often;
   Bugzilla was 1.x.x when it was first created, and went to 2.x.x when it was
   re-written in perl in Sept 1998. The major version 3.x.x, released in early
   2007, is pretty far from what the 2.x.x series looked like, both about its
   UI and its code.

   The second number in the version is called the 'minor number', and a release
   that changes the minor number is called a 'point release'. An even number in
   this position (2.18, 2.20, 2.22, 3.0, 3.2, etc.) represents a stable
   version, while an odd number (2.19, 2.21, 2.23, etc.) represents a
   development version. In the past, stable point releases were feature-based,
   coming when certain enhancements had been completed, or the Bugzilla
   development team felt that enough progress had been made overall. As of
   version 2.18, however, Bugzilla has moved to a time-based release schedule;
   current plans are to create a stable point release every 6 months or so
   after 2.18 is deployed.

   The third number in the Bugzilla version represents a bugfix version. Bugfix
   Revisions are released only to address security vulnerabilities and, for a
   limited period, bug fixes. Once enough of these bugfixes have accumulated
   (or a new security vulnerability is identified and closed), a bugfix release
   is made. As an example, 2.20.3 was a bugfix release, and improved on 2.20.2.

   Note When reading version numbers, everything separated by a point ('.')
   should be read as a single number. It is not the same as decimal. 2.22 is
   newer than 2.8 because minor version 22 is greater than minor version 8. The
   now unsupported release 2.16.11 was newer than 2.16.9 (because bugfix 11 is
   greater than bugfix 9. This is confusing to some people who aren't used to
      dealing with software.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.14.2. Upgrading - Notifications

   Bugzilla 3.0 introduces the ability to automatically notify administrators
   when new releases are available, based on the upgrade_notification
   parameter, see Section 3.1. Administrators will see these notifications when
   they access the index.cgi page, i.e. generally when logging in. Bugzilla
   will check once per day for new releases, unless the parameter is set to
   "disabled". If you are behind a proxy, you may have to set the proxy_url
   parameter accordingly. If the proxy requires authentication, use the
   http://user:pass@proxy_url/ syntax.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.14.3. Upgrading - Methods and Procedure

   There are three different ways to upgrade your installation.

    1. Using CVS (Section 3.14.3.1)
    2. Downloading a new tarball (Section 3.14.3.2)
    3. Applying the relevant patches (Section 3.14.3.3)

   Each of these options has its own pros and cons; the one that's right for
   you depends on how long it has been since you last installed, the degree to
   which you have customized your installation, and/or your network
   configuration. (Some discussion of the various methods of updating compared
   with degree and methods of local customization can be found in Section
   6.2.2.)

   The larger the jump you are trying to make, the more difficult it is going
   to be to upgrade if you have made local customizations. Upgrading from 2.22
   to 2.22.1 should be fairly painless even if you are heavily customized, but
   going from 2.18 to 3.0 is going to mean a fair bit of work re-writing your
   local changes to use the new files, logic, templates, etc. If you have done
   no local changes at all, however, then upgrading should be approximately the
   same amount of work regardless of how long it has been since your version
   was released.

   Warning Upgrading is a one-way process. You should backup your database and
   current Bugzilla directory before attempting the upgrade. If you wish to
   revert to the old Bugzilla version for any reason, you will have to restore
      from these backups.

   The examples in the following sections are written as though the user were
   updating to version 2.22.1, but the procedures are the same regardless of
   whether one is updating to a new point release or simply trying to obtain a
   new bugfix release. Also, in the examples the user's Bugzilla installation
   is found at /var/www/html/bugzilla. If that is not the same as the location
   of your Bugzilla installation, simply substitute the proper paths where
   appropriate.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.14.3.1. Upgrading using CVS

   Every release of Bugzilla, whether it is a point release or a bugfix, is
   tagged in CVS. Also, every tarball that has been distributed since version
   2.12 has been created in such a way that it can be used with CVS once it is
   unpacked. Doing so, however, requires that you are able to access
   cvs-mirror.mozilla.org on port 2401, which may not be an option or a
   possibility for some users, especially those behind a highly restrictive
   firewall.

   Tip If you can, updating using CVS is probably the most painless method,
      especially if you have a lot of local changes.

   The following shows the sequence of commands needed to update a Bugzilla
   installation via CVS, and a typical series of results.
bash$ cd /var/www/html/bugzilla
bash$ cvs login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:2401/cvsroot
CVS password: ('anonymous', or just leave it blank)
bash$ cvs -q update -r BUGZILLA-2_22_1 -dP
P checksetup.pl
P collectstats.pl
P docs/rel_notes.txt
P template/en/default/list/quips.html.tmpl
(etc.)

   Caution If a line in the output from cvs update begins with a C, then that
   represents a file with local changes that CVS was unable to properly merge.
   You need to resolve these conflicts manually before Bugzilla (or at least
      the portion using that file) will be usable.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.14.3.2. Upgrading using the tarball

   If you are unable (or unwilling) to use CVS, another option that's always
   available is to obtain the latest tarball from the Download Page and create
   a new Bugzilla installation from that.

   This sequence of commands shows how to get the tarball from the
   command-line; it is also possible to download it from the site directly in a
   web browser. If you go that route, save the file to the /var/www/html
   directory (or its equivalent, if you use something else) and omit the first
   three lines of the example.
bash$ cd /var/www/html
bash$ wget http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/webtools/bugzilla-2.22.1.tar.
gz
(Output omitted)
bash$ tar xzvf bugzilla-2.22.1.tar.gz
bugzilla-2.22.1/
bugzilla-2.22.1/.cvsignore
(Output truncated)
bash$ cd bugzilla-2.22.1
bash$ cp ../bugzilla/localconfig* .
bash$ cp -r ../bugzilla/data .
bash$ cd ..
bash$ mv bugzilla bugzilla.old
bash$ mv bugzilla-2.22.1 bugzilla

   Warning The cp commands both end with periods which is a very important
   detail, it tells the shell that the destination directory is the current
      working directory.

   This upgrade method will give you a clean install of Bugzilla with the same
   version as the tarball. That's fine if you don't have any local
   customizations that you want to maintain, but if you do then you will need
   to reapply them by hand to the appropriate files.

   It's worth noting that since 2.12, the Bugzilla tarballs come CVS-ready, so
   if you decide at a later date that you'd rather use CVS as an upgrade
   method, your code will already be set up for it.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.14.3.3. Upgrading using patches

   If you are doing a bugfix upgrade -- that is, one where only the last number
   of the revision changes, such as from 2.22 to 2.22.1 -- then you have the
   option of obtaining and applying a patch file from the Download Page. This
   file is made available by the Bugzilla Development Team, and is a collection
   of all the bug fixes and security patches that have been made since the last
   bugfix release. If you are planning to upgrade via patches, it is safer to
   grab this developer-made patch file than to read the patch notes and apply
   all (or even just some of) the patches oneself, as sometimes patches on bugs
   get changed before they get checked in.

   As above, this example starts with obtaining the file via the command line.
   If you have already downloaded it, you can omit the first two commands.
bash$ cd /var/www/html/bugzilla
bash$ wget http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/webtools/bugzilla-2.22-to-2.2
2.1.diff.gz
(Output omitted)
bash$ gunzip bugzilla-2.22-to-2.22.1.diff.gz
bash$ patch -p1 < bugzilla-2.22-to-2.22.1.diff
patching file checksetup.pl
patching file collectstats.pl
(etc.)

   Warning Be aware that upgrading from a patch file does not change the
   entries in your CVS directory. This could make it more difficult to upgrade
      using CVS (Section 3.14.3.1) in the future.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.14.4. Completing Your Upgrade

   Regardless of which upgrade method you choose, you will need to run
   ./checksetup.pl before your Bugzilla upgrade will be complete.
bash$ cd bugzilla
bash$ ./checksetup.pl

   Warning The period at the beginning of the command ./checksetup.pl is
      important and can not be omitted.

   If you have done a lot of local modifications, it wouldn't hurt to run the
   Bugzilla Testing suite. This is not a required step, but it isn't going to
   hurt anything, and might help point out some areas that could be improved.
   (More information on the test suite can be had by following this link to the
   appropriate section in the Developers' Guide.)
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Bugzilla Security

   While some of the items in this chapter are related to the operating system
   Bugzilla is running on or some of the support software required to run
   Bugzilla, it is all related to protecting your data. This is not intended to
   be a comprehensive guide to securing Linux, Apache, MySQL, or any other
   piece of software mentioned. There is no substitute for active
   administration and monitoring of a machine. The key to good security is
   actually right in the middle of the word: U R It.

   While programmers in general always strive to write secure code, accidents
   can and do happen. The best approach to security is to always assume that
   the program you are working with isn't 100% secure and restrict its access
   to other parts of your machine as much as possible.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1. Operating System

4.1.1. TCP/IP Ports

   The TCP/IP standard defines more than 65,000 ports for sending and receiving
   traffic. Of those, Bugzilla needs exactly one to operate (different
   configurations and options may require up to 3). You should audit your
   server and make sure that you aren't listening on any ports you don't need
   to be. It's also highly recommended that the server Bugzilla resides on,
   along with any other machines you administer, be placed behind some kind of
   firewall.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.2. System User Accounts

   Many daemons, such as Apache's httpd or MySQL's mysqld, run as either "root"
   or "nobody". This is even worse on Windows machines where the majority of
   services run as "SYSTEM". While running as "root" or "SYSTEM" introduces
   obvious security concerns, the problems introduced by running everything as
   "nobody" may not be so obvious. Basically, if you run every daemon as
   "nobody" and one of them gets compromised it can compromise every other
   daemon running as "nobody" on your machine. For this reason, it is
   recommended that you create a user account for each daemon.

   Note You will need to set the webservergroup option in localconfig to the
   group your webserver runs as. This will allow ./checksetup.pl to set file
      permissions on Unix systems so that nothing is world-writable.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3. The chroot Jail

   If your system supports it, you may wish to consider running Bugzilla inside
   of a chroot jail. This option provides unprecedented security by restricting
   anything running inside the jail from accessing any information outside of
   it. If you wish to use this option, please consult the documentation that
   came with your system.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2. MySQL

4.2.1. The MySQL System Account

   As mentioned in Section 4.1.2, the MySQL daemon should run as a
   non-privileged, unique user. Be sure to consult the MySQL documentation or
   the documentation that came with your system for instructions.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2.2. The MySQL "root" and "anonymous" Users

   By default, MySQL comes with a "root" user with a blank password and an
   "anonymous" user, also with a blank password. In order to protect your data,
   the "root" user should be given a password and the anonymous user should be
   disabled.

   Example 4-1. Assigning the MySQL "root" User a Password
bash$ mysql mysql
mysql> UPDATE user SET password = password('new_password') WHERE user = 'root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   Example 4-2. Disabling the MySQL "anonymous" User
bash$ mysql -u root -p mysql            (1)
Enter Password: new_password
mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE user = '';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   (1) 
          This command assumes that you have already completed Example 4-1.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2.3. Network Access

   If MySQL and your webserver both run on the same machine and you have no
   other reason to access MySQL remotely, then you should disable the network
   access. This, along with the suggestion in Section 4.1.1, will help protect
   your system from any remote vulnerabilities in MySQL.

   Example 4-3. Disabling Networking in MySQL

   Simply enter the following in /etc/my.cnf:
[mysqld]
# Prevent network access to MySQL.
skip-networking

4.3. Web server

4.3.1. Disabling Remote Access to Bugzilla Configuration Files

   There are many files that are placed in the Bugzilla directory area that
   should not be accessible from the web. Because of the way Bugzilla is
   currently layed out, the list of what should and should not be accessible is
   rather complicated. A quick way is to run testserver.pl to check if your web
   server serves Bugzilla files as expected. If not, you may want to follow the
   few steps below.

   Tip Bugzilla ships with the ability to create .htaccess files that enforce
   these rules. Instructions for enabling these directives in Apache can be
      found in Section 2.2.4.1

     * In the main Bugzilla directory, you should:
          + Block: *.pl, *localconfig*
     * In data:
          + Block everything
          + But allow: duplicates.rdf
     * In data/webdot:
          + If you use a remote webdot server:
               o Block everything
               o But allow *.dot only for the remote webdot server
          + Otherwise, if you use a local GraphViz:
               o Block everything
               o But allow: *.png, *.gif, *.jpg, *.map
          + And if you don't use any dot:
               o Block everything
     * In Bugzilla:
          + Block everything
     * In template:
          + Block everything

   Be sure to test that data that should not be accessed remotely is properly
   blocked. Of particular interest is the localconfig file which contains your
   database password. Also, be aware that many editors create temporary and
   backup files in the working directory and that those should also not be
   accessible. For more information, see bug 186383 or Bugtraq ID 6501. To
   test, simply run testserver.pl, as said above.

   Tip Be sure to check Section 2.2.4 for instructions specific to the web
      server you use.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.4. Bugzilla

4.4.1. Prevent users injecting malicious Javascript

   If you installed Bugzilla version 2.22 or later from scratch, then the utf8
   parameter is switched on by default. This makes Bugzilla explicitly set the
   character encoding, following a CERT advisory recommending exactly this. The
   following therefore does not apply to you; just keep utf8 turned on.

   If you've upgraded from an older version, then it may be possible for a
   Bugzilla user to take advantage of character set encoding ambiguities to
   inject HTML into Bugzilla comments. This could include malicious scripts.
   This is because due to internationalization concerns, we are unable to turn
   the utf8 parameter on by default for upgraded installations. Turning it on
   manually will prevent this problem.
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Using Bugzilla

5.1. Introduction

   This section contains information for end-users of Bugzilla. There is a
   Bugzilla test installation, called Landfill, which you are welcome to play
   with (if it's up). However, not all of the Bugzilla installations there will
   necessarily have all Bugzilla features enabled, and different installations
   run different versions, so some things may not quite work as this document
   describes.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.2. Create a Bugzilla Account

   If you want to use Bugzilla, first you need to create an account. Consult
   with the administrator responsible for your installation of Bugzilla for the
   URL you should use to access it. If you're test-driving Bugzilla, use this
   URL: http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-3.0-branch/.

    1. On the home page index.cgi, click the "Open a new Bugzilla account"
       link, or the "New Account" link available in the footer of pages. Now
       enter your email address, then click the "Send" button.

    Note If none of these links is available, this means that the administrator
   of the installation has disabled self-registration. This means that only an
   administrator can create accounts for other users. One reason could be that
      this installation is private.

       Note Also, if only some users are allowed to create an account on the
   installation, you may see these links but your registration may fail if your
   email address doesn't match the ones accepted by the installation. This is
      another way to restrict who can access and edit bugs in this installation.
    2. Within moments, and if your registration is accepted, you should receive
       an email to the address you provided, which contains your login name
       (generally the same as the email address), and two URLs with a token (a
       random string generated by the installation) to confirm, respectively
       cancel, your registration. This is a way to prevent users from abusing
       the generation of user accounts, for instance by entering inexistent
       email addresses, or email addresses which do not belong to them.
    3. By default, you have 3 days to confirm your registration. Past this
       timeframe, the token is invalidated and the registration is
       automatically canceled. You can also cancel this registration sooner by
       using the appropriate URL in the email you got.
    4. If you confirm your registration, Bugzilla will ask you your real name
       (optional, but recommended) and your password, which must be between 3
       and 16 characters long.
    5. Now all you need to do is to click the "Log In" link in the footer at
       the bottom of the page in your browser, enter your email address and
       password you just chose into the login form, and click the "Log in"
       button.

   You are now logged in. Bugzilla uses cookies to remember you are logged in
   so, unless you have cookies disabled or your IP address changes, you should
   not have to log in again during your session.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.3. Anatomy of a Bug

   The core of Bugzilla is the screen which displays a particular bug. It's a
   good place to explain some Bugzilla concepts. Bug 1 on Landfill is a good
   example. Note that the labels for most fields are hyperlinks; clicking them
   will take you to context-sensitive help on that particular field. Fields
   marked * may not be present on every installation of Bugzilla.

    1. Product and Component: Bugs are divided up by Product and Component,
       with a Product having one or more Components in it. For example,
       bugzilla.mozilla.org's "Bugzilla" Product is composed of several
       Components:

       Administration: Administration of a Bugzilla installation.
   Bugzilla-General: Anything that doesn't fit in the other components, or
   spans multiple components.
       Creating/Changing Bugs: Creating, changing, and viewing bugs.
       Documentation: The Bugzilla documentation, including The Bugzilla Guide.
       Email: Anything to do with email sent by Bugzilla.
       Installation: The installation process of Bugzilla.
   Query/Buglist: Anything to do with searching for bugs and viewing the
   buglists.
       Reporting/Charting: Getting reports from Bugzilla.
   User Accounts: Anything about managing a user account from the user's
   perspective. Saved queries, creating accounts, changing passwords, logging
   in, etc.
   User Interface: General issues having to do with the user interface
   cosmetics (not functionality) including cosmetic issues, HTML templates,
   etc.
    2. Status and Resolution: These define exactly what state the bug is in -
       from not even being confirmed as a bug, through to being fixed and the
       fix confirmed by Quality Assurance. The different possible values for
       Status and Resolution on your installation should be documented in the
       context-sensitive help for those items.
    3. Assigned To: The person responsible for fixing the bug.
    4. *QA Contact: The person responsible for quality assurance on this bug.
    5. *URL: A URL associated with the bug, if any.
    6. Summary: A one-sentence summary of the problem.
    7. *Status Whiteboard: (a.k.a. Whiteboard) A free-form text area for adding
       short notes and tags to a bug.
    8. *Keywords: The administrator can define keywords which you can use to
       tag and categorise bugs - e.g. The Mozilla Project has keywords like
       crash and regression.
    9. Platform and OS: These indicate the computing environment where the bug
       was found.
   10. Version: The "Version" field is usually used for versions of a product
       which have been released, and is set to indicate which versions of a
       Component have the particular problem the bug report is about.
   11. Priority: The bug assignee uses this field to prioritize his or her
       bugs. It's a good idea not to change this on other people's bugs.
   12. Severity: This indicates how severe the problem is - from blocker
       ("application unusable") to trivial ("minor cosmetic issue"). You can
       also use this field to indicate whether a bug is an enhancement request.
   13. *Target: (a.k.a. Target Milestone) A future version by which the bug is
       to be fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project's milestones for future Bugzilla
       versions are 2.18, 2.20, 3.0, etc. Milestones are not restricted to
       numbers, thought - you can use any text strings, such as dates.
   14. Reporter: The person who filed the bug.
   15. CC list: A list of people who get mail when the bug changes.
   16. *Time Tracking: This form can be used for time tracking. To use this
       feature, you have to be blessed group membership specified by the
       "timetrackinggroup" parameter.

       Orig. Est.: This field shows the original estimated time.
   Current Est.: This field shows the current estimated time. This number is
   calculated from "Hours Worked" and "Hours Left".
       Hours Worked: This field shows the number of hours worked.
   Hours Left: This field shows the "Current Est." - "Hours Worked". This value
   + "Hours Worked" will become the new Current Est.
       %Complete: This field shows what percentage of the task is complete.
   Gain: This field shows the number of hours that the bug is ahead of the
   "Orig. Est.".
       Deadline: This field shows the deadline for this bug.
   17. Attachments: You can attach files (e.g. testcases or patches) to bugs.
       If there are any attachments, they are listed in this section.
       Attachments are normally stored in the Bugzilla database, unless they
       are marked as Big Files, which are stored directly on disk.
   18. *Dependencies: If this bug cannot be fixed unless other bugs are fixed
       (depends on), or this bug stops other bugs being fixed (blocks), their
       numbers are recorded here.
   19. *Votes: Whether this bug has any votes.
   20. Additional Comments: You can add your two cents to the bug discussion
       here, if you have something worthwhile to say.

5.4. Life Cycle of a Bug

   The life cycle, also known as work flow, of a bug is currently hardcoded
   into Bugzilla. Figure 5-1 contains a graphical representation of this life
   cycle. If you wish to customize this image for your site, the diagram file
   is available in Dia's native XML format.

   Figure 5-1. Lifecycle of a Bugzilla Bug

   [bzLifecycle.png]
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5. Searching for Bugs

   The Bugzilla Search page is the interface where you can find any bug report,
   comment, or patch currently in the Bugzilla system. You can play with it
   here: http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-3.0-branch/query.cgi.

   The Search page has controls for selecting different possible values for all
   of the fields in a bug, as described above. For some fields, multiple values
   can be selected. In those cases, Bugzilla returns bugs where the content of
   the field matches any one of the selected values. If none is selected, then
   the field can take any value.

   Once you've run a search, you can save it as a Saved Search, which appears
   in the page footer. On the Saved Searches tab of your User Preferences page
   (the Prefs link in Bugzilla's footer), members of the group defined in the
   querysharegroup parameter can share such Saved Searches with user groups so
   that other users may use them. At the same place, you can see Saved Searches
   other users are sharing, and have them show up in your personal Bugzilla
   footer along with your own Saved Searches. If somebody is sharing a Search
   with a group she or he is allowed to assign users to, the sharer may opt to
   have the Search show up in the group's direct members' footers by default.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5.1. Boolean Charts

   Highly advanced querying is done using Boolean Charts.

   The boolean charts further restrict the set of results returned by a query.
   It is possible to search for bugs based on elaborate combinations of
   criteria.

   The simplest boolean searches have only one term. These searches permit the
   selected left field to be compared using a selectable operator to a
   specified value. Using the "And," "Or," and "Add Another Boolean Chart"
   buttons, additional terms can be included in the query, further altering the
   list of bugs returned by the query.

   There are three fields in each row of a boolean search.

     * Field: the items being searched
     * Operator: the comparison operator
     * Value: the value to which the field is being compared
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5.1.1. Pronoun Substitution

   Sometimes, a query needs to compare a field containing a user's ID (such as
   ReportedBy) with a user's ID (such as the user running the query or the user
   to whom each bug is assigned). When the operator is either "equals" or
   "notequals", the value can be "%reporter%", "%assignee%", "%qacontact%", or
   "%user%." The user pronoun refers to the user who is executing the query or,
   in the case of whining reports, the user who will be the recipient of the
   report. The reporter, assignee, and qacontact pronouns refer to the
   corresponding fields in the bug.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5.1.2. Negation

   At first glance, negation seems redundant. Rather than searching for

     NOT("summary" "contains the string" "foo"),

   one could search for

     ("summary" "does not contain the string" "foo").

   However, the search

     ("CC" "does not contain the string" "@mozilla.org")

   would find every bug where anyone on the CC list did not contain
   "@mozilla.org" while

     NOT("CC" "contains the string" "@mozilla.org")

   would find every bug where there was nobody on the CC list who did contain
   the string. Similarly, the use of negation also permits complex expressions
   to be built using terms OR'd together and then negated. Negation permits
   queries such as

     NOT(("product" "equals" "update") OR ("component" "equals"
     "Documentation"))

   to find bugs that are neither in the update product or in the documentation
   component or

     NOT(("commenter" "equals" "%assignee%") OR ("component" "equals"
     "Documentation"))

   to find non-documentation bugs on which the assignee has never commented.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5.1.3. Multiple Charts

   The terms within a single row of a boolean chart are all constraints on a
   single piece of data. If you are looking for a bug that has two different
   people cc'd on it, then you need to use two boolean charts. A search for

     ("cc" "contains the string" "foo@") AND ("cc" "contains the string"
     "@mozilla.org")

   would return only bugs with "foo@mozilla.org" on the cc list. If you wanted
   bugs where there is someone on the cc list containing "foo@" and someone
   else containing "@mozilla.org", then you would need two boolean charts.

     First chart: ("cc" "contains the string" "foo@")

     Second chart: ("cc" "contains the string" "@mozilla.org")

   The bugs listed will be only the bugs where ALL the charts are true.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5.2. Quicksearch

   Quicksearch is a single-text-box query tool which uses metacharacters to
   indicate what is to be searched. For example, typing "foo|bar" into
   Quicksearch would search for "foo" or "bar" in the summary and status
   whiteboard of a bug; adding ":BazProduct" would search only in that product.
   You can use it to find a bug by its number or its alias, too.

   You'll find the Quicksearch box in Bugzilla's footer area. On Bugzilla's
   front page, there is an additional Help link which details how to use it.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5.3. Bug Lists

   If you run a search, a list of matching bugs will be returned.

   The format of the list is configurable. For example, it can be sorted by
   clicking the column headings. Other useful features can be accessed using
   the links at the bottom of the list:

   Long Format: this gives you a large page with a non-editable summary of the
   fields of each bug.
   XML: get the buglist in the XML format.
   CSV: get the buglist as comma-separated values, for import into e.g. a
   spreadsheet.
   Feed: get the buglist as an Atom feed. Copy this link into your favorite
   feed reader. If you are using Firefox, you can also save the list as a live
   bookmark by clicking the live bookmark icon in the status bar. To limit the
   number of bugs in the feed, add a limit=n parameter to the URL.
   iCalendar: Get the buglist as an iCalendar file. Each bug is represented as
   a to-do item in the imported calendar.
   Change Columns: change the bug attributes which appear in the list.
   Change several bugs at once: If your account is sufficiently empowered, and
   more than one bug appear in the bug list, this link is displayed which lets
   you make the same change to all the bugs in the list - for example, changing
   their assignee.
   Send mail to bug assignees: If more than one bug appear in the bug list and
   there are at least two distinct bug assignees, this links is displayed which
   lets you easily send a mail to the assignees of all bugs on the list.
   Edit Search: If you didn't get exactly the results you were looking for, you
   can return to the Query page through this link and make small revisions to
   the query you just made so you get more accurate results.
   Remember Search As: You can give a search a name and remember it; a link
   will appear in your page footer giving you quick access to run it again
   later.

   If you would like to access the bug list from another program it is often
   useful to have the list returned in something other than HTML. By adding the
   ctype=type parameter into the bug list URL you can specify several alternate
   formats. Besides the types described above, the following formats are also
   supported: ECMAScript, also known as JavaScript (ctype=js), and Resource
   Description Framework RDF/XML (ctype=rdf).
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5.4. Adding/removing tags to/from bugs

   You can add and remove tags from individual bugs, which let you find and
   manage them more easily. Creating a new tag automatically generates a saved
   search - whose name is the name of the tag - which lists bugs with this tag.
   This saved search will be displayed in the footer of pages by default, as
   all other saved searches. The main difference between tags and normal saved
   searches is that saved searches, as described in the previous section, are
   stored in the form of a list of matching criteria, while the saved search
   generated by tags is a list of bug numbers. Consequently, you can easily
   edit this list by either adding or removing tags from bugs. To enable this
   feature, you have to turn on the "Enable tags for bugs" user preference, see
   Section 5.10. This feature is disabled by default.

   This feature is useful when you want to keep track of several bugs, but for
   different reasons. Instead of adding yourself to the CC list of all these
   bugs and mixing all these reasons, you can now store these bugs in separate
   lists, e.g. "Keep in mind", "Interesting bugs", or "Triage". One big
   advantage of this way to manage bugs is that you can easily add or remove
   bugs one by one, which is not possible to do with saved searches without
   having to edit the search criteria again.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.6. Filing Bugs

5.6.1. Reporting a New Bug

   Years of bug writing experience has been distilled for your reading pleasure
   into the Bug Writing Guidelines. While some of the advice is
   Mozilla-specific, the basic principles of reporting Reproducible, Specific
   bugs, isolating the Product you are using, the Version of the Product, the
   Component which failed, the Hardware Platform, and Operating System you were
   using at the time of the failure go a long way toward ensuring accurate,
   responsible fixes for the bug that bit you.

   The procedure for filing a bug is as follows:

    1. Click the "New" link available in the footer of pages, or the "Enter a
       new bug report" link displayed on the home page of the Bugzilla
       installation.

   Note If you want to file a test bug to see how Bugzilla works, you can do it
      on one of our test installations on Landfill.
    2. You first have to select the product in which you found a bug.
    3. You now see a form where you can specify the component (part of the
       product which is affected by the bug you discovered; if you have no
       idea, just select "General" if such a component exists), the version of
       the program you were using, the Operating System and platform your
       program is running on and the severity of the bug (if the bug you found
       crashes the program, it's probably a major or a critical bug; if it's a
       typo somewhere, that's something pretty minor; if it's something you
       would like to see implemented, then that's an enhancement).
    4. You now have to give a short but descriptive summary of the bug you
       found. "My program is crashing all the time" is a very poor summary and
       doesn't help developers at all. Try something more meaningful or your
       bug will probably be ignored due to a lack of precision. The next step
       is to give a very detailed list of steps to reproduce the problem you
       encountered. Try to limit these steps to a minimum set required to
       reproduce the problem. This will make the life of developers easier, and
       the probability that they consider your bug in a reasonable timeframe
       will be much higher.

      Note Try to make sure that everything in the summary is also in the first
   comment. Summaries are often updated and this will ensure your original
      information is easily accessible.
    5. As you file the bug, you can also attach a document (testcase, patch, or
       screenshot of the problem).
    6. Depending on the Bugzilla installation you are using and the product in
       which you are filing the bug, you can also request developers to
       consider your bug in different ways (such as requesting review for the
       patch you just attached, requesting your bug to block the next release
       of the product, and many other product specific requests).
    7. Now is a good time to read your bug report again. Remove all
       misspellings, otherwise your bug may not be found by developers running
       queries for some specific words, and so your bug would not get any
       attention. Also make sure you didn't forget any important information
       developers should know in order to reproduce the problem, and make sure
       your description of the problem is explicit and clear enough. When you
       think your bug report is ready to go, the last step is to click the
       "Commit" button to add your report into the database.

   You do not need to put "any" or similar strings in the URL field. If there
   is no specific URL associated with the bug, leave this field blank.

   If you feel a bug you filed was incorrectly marked as a DUPLICATE of
   another, please question it in your bug, not the bug it was duped to. Feel
   free to CC the person who duped it if they are not already CCed.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.6.2. Clone an Existing Bug

   Starting with version 2.20, Bugzilla has a feature that allows you to clone
   an existing bug. The newly created bug will inherit most settings from the
   old bug. This allows you to track more easily similar concerns in a new bug.
   To use this, go to the bug that you want to clone, then click the "Clone
   This Bug" link on the bug page. This will take you to the "Enter Bug" page
   that is filled with the values that the old bug has. You can change those
   values and/or texts if needed.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7. Attachments

   You should use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII
   data, such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it
   doesn't bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause people to
   receive fat, useless mails.

   You should make sure to trim screenshots. There's no need to show the whole
   screen if you are pointing out a single-pixel problem.

   Bugzilla stores and uses a Content-Type for each attachment (e.g.
   text/html). To download an attachment as a different Content-Type (e.g.
   application/xhtml+xml), you can override this using a 'content_type'
   parameter on the URL, e.g. &content_type=text/plain.

   If you have a really large attachment, something that does not need to be
   recorded forever (as most attachments are), or something that is too big for
   your database, you can mark your attachment as a "Big File", assuming the
   administrator of the installation has enabled this feature. Big Files are
   stored directly on disk instead of in the database. The maximum size of a
   "Big File" is normally larger than the maximum size of a regular attachment.
   Independently of the storage system used, an administrator can delete these
   attachments at any time. Nevertheless, if these files are stored in the
   database, the "allow_attachment_deletion" parameter (which is turned off by
   default) must be enabled in order to delete them.

   Also, if the administrator turned on the "allow_attach_url" parameter, you
   can enter the URL pointing to the attachment instead of uploading the
   attachment itself. For example, this is useful if you want to point to an
   external application, a website or a very large file. Note that there is no
   guarantee that the source file will always be available, nor that its
   content will remain unchanged.

5.7.1. Patch Viewer

   Viewing and reviewing patches in Bugzilla is often difficult due to lack of
   context, improper format and the inherent readability issues that raw
   patches present. Patch Viewer is an enhancement to Bugzilla designed to fix
   that by offering increased context, linking to sections, and integrating
   with Bonsai, LXR and CVS.

   Patch viewer allows you to:

   View patches in color, with side-by-side view rather than trying to
   interpret the contents of the patch.
   See the difference between two patches.
   Get more context in a patch.
   Collapse and expand sections of a patch for easy reading.
   Link to a particular section of a patch for discussion or review
   Go to Bonsai or LXR to see more context, blame, and cross-references for the
   part of the patch you are looking at
   Create a rawtext unified format diff out of any patch, no matter what format
   it came from
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.1.1. Viewing Patches in Patch Viewer

   The main way to view a patch in patch viewer is to click on the "Diff" link
   next to a patch in the Attachments list on a bug. You may also do this
   within the edit window by clicking the "View Attachment As Diff" button in
   the Edit Attachment screen.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.1.2. Seeing the Difference Between Two Patches

   To see the difference between two patches, you must first view the newer
   patch in Patch Viewer. Then select the older patch from the dropdown at the
   top of the page ("Differences between [dropdown] and this patch") and click
   the "Diff" button. This will show you what is new or changed in the newer
   patch.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.1.3. Getting More Context in a Patch

   To get more context in a patch, you put a number in the textbox at the top
   of Patch Viewer ("Patch / File / [textbox]") and hit enter. This will give
   you that many lines of context before and after each change. Alternatively,
   you can click on the "File" link there and it will show each change in the
   full context of the file. This feature only works against files that were
   diffed using "cvs diff".
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.1.4. Collapsing and Expanding Sections of a Patch

   To view only a certain set of files in a patch (for example, if a patch is
   absolutely huge and you want to only review part of it at a time), you can
   click the "(+)" and "(-)" links next to each file (to expand it or collapse
   it). If you want to collapse all files or expand all files, you can click
   the "Collapse All" and "Expand All" links at the top of the page.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.1.5. Linking to a Section of a Patch

   To link to a section of a patch (for example, if you want to be able to give
   someone a URL to show them which part you are talking about) you simply
   click the "Link Here" link on the section header. The resulting URL can be
   copied and used in discussion.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.1.6. Going to Bonsai and LXR

   To go to Bonsai to get blame for the lines you are interested in, you can
   click the "Lines XX-YY" link on the section header you are interested in.
   This works even if the patch is against an old version of the file, since
   Bonsai stores all versions of the file.

   To go to LXR, you click on the filename on the file header (unfortunately,
   since LXR only does the most recent version, line numbers are likely to
   rot).
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.1.7. Creating a Unified Diff

   If the patch is not in a format that you like, you can turn it into a
   unified diff format by clicking the "Raw Unified" link at the top of the
   page.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.8. Hints and Tips

   This section distills some Bugzilla tips and best practices that have been
   developed.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.8.1. Autolinkification

   Bugzilla comments are plain text - so typing <U> will produce less-than, U,
   greater-than rather than underlined text. However, Bugzilla will
   automatically make hyperlinks out of certain sorts of text in comments. For
   example, the text "http://www.bugzilla.org" will be turned into a link:
   http://www.bugzilla.org. Other strings which get linkified in the obvious
   manner are:

   bug 12345
   comment 7
   bug 23456, comment 53
   attachment 4321
   mailto:george@example.com
   george@example.com
   ftp://ftp.mozilla.org
   Most other sorts of URL

   A corollary here is that if you type a bug number in a comment, you should
   put the word "bug" before it, so it gets autolinkified for the convenience
   of others.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.8.2. Comments

   If you are changing the fields on a bug, only comment if either you have
   something pertinent to say, or Bugzilla requires it. Otherwise, you may spam
   people unnecessarily with bug mail. To take an example: a user can set up
   their account to filter out messages where someone just adds themselves to
   the CC field of a bug (which happens a lot.) If you come along, add yourself
   to the CC field, and add a comment saying "Adding self to CC", then that
   person gets a pointless piece of mail they would otherwise have avoided.

   Don't use sigs in comments. Signing your name ("Bill") is acceptable, if you
   do it out of habit, but full mail/news-style four line ASCII art creations
   are not.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.8.3. Dependency Tree

   On the "Dependency tree" page linked from each bug page, you can see the
   dependency relationship from the bug as a tree structure.

   You can change how much depth to show, and you can hide resolved bugs from
   this page. You can also collaps/expand dependencies for each bug on the tree
   view, using the [-]/[+] buttons that appear before its summary. This option
   is not available for terminal bugs in the tree (that don't have further
   dependencies).
     _________________________________________________________________

5.9. Time Tracking Information

   Users who belong to the group specified by the "timetrackinggroup" parameter
   have access to time-related fields. Developers can see deadlines and
   estimated times to fix bugs, and can provide time spent on these bugs.

   At any time, a summary of the time spent by developers on bugs is accessible
   either from bug lists when clicking the "Time Summary" button or from
   individual bugs when clicking the "Summarize time" link in the time tracking
   table. The summarize_time.cgi page lets you view this information either per
   developer or per bug, and can be split on a month basis to have greater
   details on how time is spent by developers.

   As soon as a bug is marked as RESOLVED, the remaining time expected to fix
   the bug is set to zero. This lets QA people set it again for their own
   usage, and it will be set to zero again when the bug will be marked as
   CLOSED.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.10. User Preferences

   Once you have logged in, you can customize various aspects of Bugzilla via
   the "Edit prefs" link in the page footer. The preferences are split into
   three tabs:
     _________________________________________________________________

5.10.1. Account Preferences

   On this tab, you can change your basic account information, including your
   password, email address and real name. For security reasons, in order to
   change anything on this page you must type your current password into the
   "Password" field at the top of the page. If you attempt to change your email
   address, a confirmation email is sent to both the old and new addresses,
   with a link to use to confirm the change. This helps to prevent account
   hijacking.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.10.2. General Preferences

   This tab allows you to change several Bugzilla behavior.

     * Field separator character for CSV files - This controls separator
       character used in CSV formatted Bug List.
     * After changing bugs - This controls which bugs or no bugs are shown in
       the page after you changed bugs. You can select the bug you've changed
       this time, or the next bug of the list.
     * Add individual bugs to saved searches - this controls whether you can
       add individual bugs to saved searches or you can't.
     * When viewing a bug, show comments in this order - This controls the
       order of comments, you can select below:

       Initial description, comment 1, comment 2, ...
       Initial description, last comment, ..., comment 2, comment 1.
       Initial last comment, ..., comment 2, comment 1, description.
     * Show a quip at the top of each bug list - This controls whether a quip
       will be shown on the Bug list page or not.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.10.3. Email Preferences

   This tab controls the amount of email Bugzilla sends you.

   The first item on this page is marked "Users to watch". When you enter one
   or more comma-delineated user accounts (usually email addresses) into the
   text entry box, you will receive a copy of all the bugmail those users are
   sent (security settings permitting). This powerful functionality enables
   seamless transitions as developers change projects or users go on holiday.

   Note The ability to watch other users may not be available in all Bugzilla
   installations. If you don't see this feature, and feel that you need it,
      speak to your administrator.

   Each user listed in the "Users watching you" field has you listed in their
   "Users to watch" list and can get bugmail according to your relationship to
   the bug and their "Field/recipient specific options" setting.

   In general, users have almost complete control over how much (or how little)
   email Bugzilla sends them. If you want to receive the maximum amount of
   email possible, click the "Enable All Mail" button. If you don't want to
   receive any email from Bugzilla at all, click the "Disable All Mail" button.

   Note Your Bugzilla administrator can stop a user from receiving bugmail by
   adding the user's name to the data/nomail file. This is a drastic step best
   taken only for disabled accounts, as it overrides the user's individual mail
      preferences.

   If you'd like to set your bugmail to something besides 'Completely ON' and
   'Completely OFF', the "Field/recipient specific options" table allows you to
   do just that. The rows of the table define events that can happen to a bug
   -- things like attachments being added, new comments being made, the
   priority changing, etc. The columns in the table define your relationship
   with the bug:

     * Reporter - Where you are the person who initially reported the bug. Your
       name/account appears in the "Reporter:" field.
     * Assignee - Where you are the person who has been designated as the one
       responsible for the bug. Your name/account appears in the "Assigned To:"
       field of the bug.
     * QA Contact - You are one of the designated QA Contacts for the bug. Your
       account appears in the "QA Contact:" text-box of the bug.
     * CC - You are on the list CC List for the bug. Your account appears in
       the "CC:" text box of the bug.
     * Voter - You have placed one or more votes for the bug. Your account
       appears only if someone clicks on the "Show votes for this bug" link on
       the bug.

   Note Some columns may not be visible for your installation, depending on
      your site's configuration.

   To fine-tune your bugmail, decide the events for which you want to receive
   bugmail; then decide if you want to receive it all the time (enable the
   checkbox for every column), or only when you have a certain relationship
   with a bug (enable the checkbox only for those columns). For example: if you
   didn't want to receive mail when someone added themselves to the CC list,
   you could uncheck all the boxes in the "CC Field Changes" line. As another
   example, if you never wanted to receive email on bugs you reported unless
   the bug was resolved, you would un-check all boxes in the "Reporter" column
   except for the one on the "The bug is resolved or verified" row.

   Note Bugzilla adds the "X-Bugzilla-Reason" header to all bugmail it sends,
   describing the recipient's relationship (AssignedTo, Reporter, QAContact,
   CC, or Voter) to the bug. This header can be used to do further client-side
      filtering.

   Two items not in the table ("Email me when someone asks me to set a flag"
   and "Email me when someone sets a flag I asked for") define how you want to
   receive bugmail with regards to flags. Their use is quite straightforward;
   enable the checkboxes if you want Bugzilla to send you mail under either of
   the above conditions.

   By default, Bugzilla sends out email regardless of who made the change...
   even if you were the one responsible for generating the email in the first
   place. If you don't care to receive bugmail from your own changes, check the
   box marked "Only email me reports of changes made by other people".
     _________________________________________________________________

5.10.4. Permissions

   This is a purely informative page which outlines your current permissions on
   this installation of Bugzilla - what product groups you are in, and whether
   you can edit bugs or perform various administration functions.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.11. Reports and Charts

   As well as the standard buglist, Bugzilla has two more ways of viewing sets
   of bugs. These are the reports (which give different views of the current
   state of the database) and charts (which plot the changes in particular sets
   of bugs over time.)
     _________________________________________________________________

5.11.1. Reports

   A report is a view of the current state of the bug database.

   You can run either an HTML-table-based report, or a graphical
   line/pie/bar-chart-based one. The two have different pages to define them,
   but are close cousins - once you've defined and viewed a report, you can
   switch between any of the different views of the data at will.

   Both report types are based on the idea of defining a set of bugs using the
   standard search interface, and then choosing some aspect of that set to plot
   on the horizontal and/or vertical axes. You can also get a form of
   3-dimensional report by choosing to have multiple images or tables.

   So, for example, you could use the search form to choose "all bugs in the
   WorldControl product", and then plot their severity against their component
   to see which component had had the largest number of bad bugs reported
   against it.

   Once you've defined your parameters and hit "Generate Report", you can
   switch between HTML, CSV, Bar, Line and Pie. (Note: Pie is only available if
   you didn't define a vertical axis, as pie charts don't have one.) The other
   controls are fairly self-explanatory; you can change the size of the image
   if you find text is overwriting other text, or the bars are too thin to see.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.11.2. Charts

   A chart is a view of the state of the bug database over time.

   Bugzilla currently has two charting systems - Old Charts and New Charts. Old
   Charts have been part of Bugzilla for a long time; they chart each status
   and resolution for each product, and that's all. They are deprecated, and
   going away soon - we won't say any more about them. New Charts are the
   future - they allow you to chart anything you can define as a search.

   Note Both charting forms require the administrator to set up the
   data-gathering script. If you can't see any charts, ask them whether they
      have done so.

   An individual line on a chart is called a data set. All data sets are
   organised into categories and subcategories. The data sets that Bugzilla
   defines automatically use the Product name as a Category and Component names
   as Subcategories, but there is no need for you to follow that naming scheme
   with your own charts if you don't want to.

   Data sets may be public or private. Everyone sees public data sets in the
   list, but only their creator sees private data sets. Only administrators can
   make data sets public. No two data sets, even two private ones, can have the
   same set of category, subcategory and name. So if you are creating private
   data sets, one idea is to have the Category be your username.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.11.2.1. Creating Charts

   You create a chart by selecting a number of data sets from the list, and
   pressing Add To List for each. In the List Of Data Sets To Plot, you can
   define the label that data set will have in the chart's legend, and also ask
   Bugzilla to Sum a number of data sets (e.g. you could Sum data sets
   representing RESOLVED, VERIFIED and CLOSED in a particular product to get a
   data set representing all the resolved bugs in that product.)

   If you've erroneously added a data set to the list, select it using the
   checkbox and click Remove. Once you add more than one data set, a "Grand
   Total" line automatically appears at the bottom of the list. If you don't
   want this, simply remove it as you would remove any other line.

   You may also choose to plot only over a certain date range, and to cumulate
   the results - that is, to plot each one using the previous one as a
   baseline, so the top line gives a sum of all the data sets. It's easier to
   try than to explain :-)

   Once a data set is in the list, one can also perform certain actions on it.
   For example, one can edit the data set's parameters (name, frequency etc.)
   if it's one you created or if you are an administrator.

   Once you are happy, click Chart This List to see the chart.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.11.2.2. Creating New Data Sets

   You may also create new data sets of your own. To do this, click the "create
   a new data set" link on the Create Chart page. This takes you to a
   search-like interface where you can define the search that Bugzilla will
   plot. At the bottom of the page, you choose the category, sub-category and
   name of your new data set.

   If you have sufficient permissions, you can make the data set public, and
   reduce the frequency of data collection to less than the default seven days.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.12. Flags

   A flag is a kind of status that can be set on bugs or attachments to
   indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state. Each installation
   can define its own set of flags that can be set on bugs or attachments.

   If your installation has defined a flag, you can set or unset that flag, and
   if your administrator has enabled requesting of flags, you can submit a
   request for another user to set the flag.

   To set a flag, select either "+" or "-" from the drop-down menu next to the
   name of the flag in the "Flags" list. The meaning of these values are
   flag-specific and thus cannot be described in this documentation, but by way
   of example, setting a flag named "review" to "+" may indicate that the
   bug/attachment has passed review, while setting it to "-" may indicate that
   the bug/attachment has failed review.

   To unset a flag, click its drop-down menu and select the blank value. Note
   that marking an attachment as obsolete automatically cancels all pending
   requests for the attachment.

   If your administrator has enabled requests for a flag, request a flag by
   selecting "?" from the drop-down menu and then entering the username of the
   user you want to set the flag in the text field next to the menu.

   A set flag appears in bug reports and on "edit attachment" pages with the
   abbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the flag
   name. For example, if Jack sets a "review" flag to "+", it appears as Jack:
   review [ + ]

   A requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended to
   the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag appended
   to the flag name within parentheses. For example, if Jack asks Jill for
   review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).

   You can browse through open requests made of you and by you by selecting 'My
   Requests' from the footer. You can also look at open requests limited by
   other requesters, requestees, products, components, and flag names from this
   page. Note that you can use '-' for requestee to specify flags with 'no
   requestee' set.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.13. Whining

   Whining is a feature in Bugzilla that can regularly annoy users at specified
   times. Using this feature, users can execute saved searches at specific
   times (i.e. the 15th of the month at midnight) or at regular intervals (i.e.
   every 15 minutes on Sundays). The results of the searches are sent to the
   user, either as a single email or as one email per bug, along with some
   descriptive text.

   Warning Throughout this section it will be assumed that all users are
   members of the bz_canusewhines group, membership in which is required in
   order to use the Whining system. You can easily make all users members of
   the bz_canusewhines group by setting the User RegExp to ".*" (without the
   quotes).

   Also worth noting is the bz_canusewhineatothers group. Members of this group
   can create whines for any user or group in Bugzilla using a extended form of
   the whining interface. Features only available to members of the
      bz_canusewhineatothers group will be noted in the appropriate places.

   Note For whining to work, a special Perl script must be executed at regular
      intervals. More information on this is available in Section 2.3.4.

   Note This section does not cover the whineatnews.pl script. See Section
      2.3.3 for more information on The Whining Cron.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.13.1. The Event

   The whining system defines an "Event" as one or more queries being executed
   at regular intervals, with the results of said queries (if there are any)
   being emailed to the user. Events are created by clicking on the "Add new
   event" button.

   Once a new event is created, the first thing to set is the "Email subject
   line". The contents of this field will be used in the subject line of every
   email generated by this event. In addition to setting a subject, space is
   provided to enter some descriptive text that will be included at the top of
   each message (to help you in understanding why you received the email in the
   first place).

   The next step is to specify when the Event is to be run (the Schedule) and
   what searches are to be performed (the Searches).
     _________________________________________________________________

5.13.2. Whining Schedule

   Each whining event is associated with zero or more schedules. A schedule is
   used to specify when the query (specified below) is to be run. A new event
   starts out with no schedules (which means it will never run, as it is not
   scheduled to run). To add a schedule, press the "Add a new schedule" button.

   Each schedule includes an interval, which you use to tell Bugzilla when the
   event should be run. An event can be run on certain days of the week,
   certain days of the month, during weekdays (defined as Monday through
   Friday), or every day.

   Warning Be careful if you set your event to run on the 29th, 30th, or 31st
   of the month, as your event may not run exactly when expected. If you want
   your event to run on the last day of the month, select "Last day of the
      month" as the interval.

   Once you have specified the day(s) on which the event is to be run, you
   should now specify the time at which the event is to be run. You can have
   the event run at a certain hour on the specified day(s), or every hour,
   half-hour, or quarter-hour on the specified day(s).

   If a single schedule does not execute an event as many times as you would
   want, you can create another schedule for the same event. For example, if
   you want to run an event on days whose numbers are divisible by seven, you
   would need to add four schedules to the event, setting the schedules to run
   on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th (one day per schedule) at whatever time (or
   times) you choose.

   Note If you are a member of the bz_canusewhineatothers group, then you will
   be presented with another option: "Mail to". Using this you can control who
   will receive the emails generated by this event. You can choose to send the
   emails to a single user (identified by email address) or a single group
   (identified by group name). To send to multiple users or groups, create a
      new schedule for each additional user/group.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.13.3. Whining Searches

   Each whining event is associated with zero or more searches. A search is any
   saved search to be run as part of the specified schedule (see above). You
   start out without any searches associated with the event (which means that
   the event will not run, as there will never be any results to return). To
   add a search, press the "Include search" button.

   The first field to examine in your newly added search is the Sort field.
   Searches are run, and results included, in the order specified by the Sort
   field. Searches with smaller Sort values will run before searches with
   bigger Sort values.

   The next field to examine is the Search field. This is where you choose the
   actual search that is to be run. Instead of defining search parameters here,
   you are asked to choose from the list of saved searches (the same list that
   appears at the bottom of every Bugzilla page). You are only allowed to
   choose from searches that you have saved yourself (the default saved search,
   "My Bugs", is not a valid choice). If you do not have any saved searches,
   you can take this opportunity to create one (see Section 5.5.3).

   Note When running queries, the whining system acts as if you are the user
   executing the query. This means that the whining system will ignore bugs
      that match your query, but that you can not access.

   Once you have chosen the saved search to be executed, give the query a
   descriptive title. This title will appear in the email, above the results of
   the query. If you choose "One message per bug", the query title will appear
   at the top of each email that contains a bug matching your query.

   Finally, decide if the results of the query should be sent in a single
   email, or if each bug should appear in its own email.

   Warning Think carefully before checking the "One message per bug" box. If
   you create a query that matches thousands of bugs, you will receive
      thousands of emails!
     _________________________________________________________________

5.13.4. Saving Your Changes

   Once you have defined at least one schedule, and created at least one query,
   go ahead and "Update/Commit". This will save your Event and make it
   available for immediate execution.

   Note If you ever feel like deleting your event, you may do so using the
   "Remove Event" button in the upper-right corner of each Event. You can also
   modify an existing event, so long as you "Update/Commit" after completing
      your modifications.
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Customizing Bugzilla

6.1. Custom Skins

   Bugzilla allows you to have multiple skins. These are custom CSS and
   possibly also custom images for Bugzilla. To create a new custom skin, you
   have two choices:

     * Make a single CSS file, and put it in the skins/contrib directory.
     * Make a directory that contains all the same CSS file names as
       skins/standard/, and put your directory in skins/contrib/.

   After you put the file or the directory there, make sure to run
   checksetup.pl so that it can reset the file permissions correctly.

   After you have installed the new skin, it will show up as an option in the
   user's General Preferences. If you would like to force a particular skin on
   all users, just select it in the Default Preferences and then uncheck
   "Enabled" on the preference.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.2. Template Customization

   Administrators can configure the look and feel of Bugzilla without having to
   edit Perl files or face the nightmare of massive merge conflicts when they
   upgrade to a newer version in the future.

   Templatization also makes localized versions of Bugzilla possible, for the
   first time. It's possible to have Bugzilla's UI language determined by the
   user's browser. More information is available in Section 6.2.6.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.2.1. Template Directory Structure

   The template directory structure starts with top level directory named
   template, which contains a directory for each installed localization. The
   next level defines the language used in the templates. Bugzilla comes with
   English templates, so the directory name is en, and we will discuss
   template/en throughout the documentation. Below template/en is the default
   directory, which contains all the standard templates shipped with Bugzilla.

   Warning A directory data/templates also exists; this is where Template
   Toolkit puts the compiled versions of the templates from either the default
   or custom directories. Do not directly edit the files in this directory, or
   all your changes will be lost the next time Template Toolkit recompiles the
      templates.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.2.2. Choosing a Customization Method

   If you want to edit Bugzilla's templates, the first decision you must make
   is how you want to go about doing so. There are two choices, and which you
   use depends mainly on the scope of your modifications, and the method you
   plan to use to upgrade Bugzilla.

   The first method of making customizations is to directly edit the templates
   found in template/en/default. This is probably the best way to go about it
   if you are going to be upgrading Bugzilla through CVS, because if you then
   execute a cvs update, any changes you have made will be merged automagically
   with the updated versions.

   Note If you use this method, and CVS conflicts occur during an update, the
   conflicted templates (and possibly other parts of your installation) will
      not work until they are resolved.

   The second method is to copy the templates to be modified into a mirrored
   directory structure under template/en/custom. Templates in this directory
   structure automatically override any identically-named and
   identically-located templates in the default directory.

   Note The custom directory does not exist at first and must be created if you
      want to use it.

   The second method of customization should be used if you use the overwriting
   method of upgrade, because otherwise your changes will be lost. This method
   may also be better if you are using the CVS method of upgrading and are
   going to make major changes, because it is guaranteed that the contents of
   this directory will not be touched during an upgrade, and you can then
   decide whether to continue using your own templates, or make the effort to
   merge your changes into the new versions by hand.

   Using this method, your installation may break if incompatible changes are
   made to the template interface. Such changes should be documented in the
   release notes, provided you are using a stable release of Bugzilla. If you
   use using unstable code, you will need to deal with this one yourself,
   although if possible the changes will be mentioned before they occur in the
   deprecations section of the previous stable release's release notes.

   Note Regardless of which method you choose, it is recommended that you run
   ./checksetup.pl after creating or editing any templates in the
   template/en/default directory, and after editing any templates in the custom
      directory.

   Warning It is required that you run ./checksetup.pl after creating a new
   template in the custom directory. Failure to do so will raise an
      incomprehensible error message.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.2.3. How To Edit Templates

   Note If you are making template changes that you intend on submitting back
   for inclusion in standard Bugzilla, you should read the relevant sections of
      the Developers' Guide.

   The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of this
   guide. It's reasonably easy to pick up by looking at the current templates;
   or, you can read the manual, available on the Template Toolkit home page.

   One thing you should take particular care about is the need to properly HTML
   filter data that has been passed into the template. This means that if the
   data can possibly contain special HTML characters such as <, and the data
   was not intended to be HTML, they need to be converted to entity form, i.e.
   &lt;. You use the 'html' filter in the Template Toolkit to do this. If you
   forget, you may open up your installation to cross-site scripting attacks.

   Also note that Bugzilla adds a few filters of its own, that are not in
   standard Template Toolkit. In particular, the 'url_quote' filter can convert
   characters that are illegal or have special meaning in URLs, such as &, to
   the encoded form, i.e. %26. This actually encodes most characters (but not
   the common ones such as letters and numbers and so on), including the
   HTML-special characters, so there's never a need to HTML filter afterwards.

   Editing templates is a good way of doing a "poor man's custom fields". For
   example, if you don't use the Status Whiteboard, but want to have a
   free-form text entry box for "Build Identifier", then you can just edit the
   templates to change the field labels. It's still be called status_whiteboard
   internally, but your users don't need to know that.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.2.4. Template Formats and Types

   Some CGI's have the ability to use more than one template. For example,
   buglist.cgi can output itself as RDF, or as two formats of HTML (complex and
   simple). The mechanism that provides this feature is extensible.

   Bugzilla can support different types of output, which again can have
   multiple formats. In order to request a certain type, you can append the
   &ctype=<contenttype> (such as rdf or html) to the <cginame>.cgi URL. If you
   would like to retrieve a certain format, you can use the &format=<format>
   (such as simple or complex) in the URL.

   To see if a CGI supports multiple output formats and types, grep the CGI for
   "get_format". If it's not present, adding multiple format/type support isn't
   too hard - see how it's done in other CGIs, e.g. config.cgi.

   To make a new format template for a CGI which supports this, open a current
   template for that CGI and take note of the INTERFACE comment (if present.)
   This comment defines what variables are passed into this template. If there
   isn't one, I'm afraid you'll have to read the template and the code to find
   out what information you get.

   Write your template in whatever markup or text style is appropriate.

   You now need to decide what content type you want your template served as.
   The content types are defined in the Bugzilla/Constants.pm file in the
   contenttypes constant. If your content type is not there, add it. Remember
   the three- or four-letter tag assigned to your content type. This tag will
   be part of the template filename.

   Note After adding or changing a content type, it's suitable to edit
   Bugzilla/Constants.pm in order to reflect the changes. Also, the file should
   be kept up to date after an upgrade if content types have been customized in
      the past.

   Save the template as <stubname>-<formatname>.<contenttypetag>.tmpl. Try out
   the template by calling the CGI as
   <cginame>.cgi?format=<formatname>&ctype=<type> .
     _________________________________________________________________

6.2.5. Particular Templates

   There are a few templates you may be particularly interested in customizing
   for your installation.

   index.html.tmpl: This is the Bugzilla front page.

   global/header.html.tmpl: This defines the header that goes on all Bugzilla
   pages. The header includes the banner, which is what appears to users and is
   probably what you want to edit instead. However the header also includes the
   HTML HEAD section, so you could for example add a stylesheet or META tag by
   editing the header.

   global/banner.html.tmpl: This contains the "banner", the part of the header
   that appears at the top of all Bugzilla pages. The default banner is
   reasonably barren, so you'll probably want to customize this to give your
   installation a distinctive look and feel. It is recommended you preserve the
   Bugzilla version number in some form so the version you are running can be
   determined, and users know what docs to read.

   global/footer.html.tmpl: This defines the footer that goes on all Bugzilla
   pages. Editing this is another way to quickly get a distinctive look and
   feel for your Bugzilla installation.

   global/variables.none.tmpl: This defines a list of terms that may be changed
   in order to "brand" the Bugzilla instance In this way, terms like "bugs" can
   be replaced with "issues" across the whole Bugzilla installation. The name
   "Bugzilla" and other words can be customized as well.

   list/table.html.tmpl: This template controls the appearance of the bug lists
   created by Bugzilla. Editing this template allows per-column control of the
   width and title of a column, the maximum display length of each entry, and
   the wrap behaviour of long entries. For long bug lists, Bugzilla inserts a
   'break' every 100 bugs by default; this behaviour is also controlled by this
   template, and that value can be modified here.

   bug/create/user-message.html.tmpl: This is a message that appears near the
   top of the bug reporting page. By modifying this, you can tell your users
   how they should report bugs.

   bug/process/midair.html.tmpl: This is the page used if two people submit
   simultaneous changes to the same bug. The second person to submit their
   changes will get this page to tell them what the first person did, and ask
   if they wish to overwrite those changes or go back and revisit the bug. The
   default title and header on this page read "Mid-air collision detected!" If
   you work in the aviation industry, or other environment where this might be
   found offensive (yes, we have true stories of this happening) you'll want to
   change this to something more appropriate for your environment.

   bug/create/create.html.tmpl and bug/create/comment.txt.tmpl: You may not
   wish to go to the effort of creating custom fields in Bugzilla, yet you want
   to make sure that each bug report contains a number of pieces of important
   information for which there is not a special field. The bug entry system has
   been designed in an extensible fashion to enable you to add arbitrary HTML
   widgets, such as drop-down lists or textboxes, to the bug entry page and
   have their values appear formatted in the initial comment. A hidden field
   that indicates the format should be added inside the form in order to make
   the template functional. Its value should be the suffix of the template
   filename. For example, if the file is called create-cust.html.tmpl, then
   <input type="hidden" name="format" value="cust">

   should be used inside the form.

   An example of this is the mozilla.org guided bug submission form. The code
   for this comes with the Bugzilla distribution as an example for you to copy.
   It can be found in the files create-guided.html.tmpl and
   comment-guided.html.tmpl.

   So to use this feature, create a custom template for enter_bug.cgi. The
   default template, on which you could base it, is
   custom/bug/create/create.html.tmpl. Call it create-<formatname>.html.tmpl,
   and in it, add widgets for each piece of information you'd like collected -
   such as a build number, or set of steps to reproduce.

   Then, create a template like custom/bug/create/comment.txt.tmpl, and call it
   comment-<formatname>.txt.tmpl. This template should reference the form
   fields you have created using the syntax [% form.<fieldname> %]. When a bug
   report is submitted, the initial comment attached to the bug report will be
   formatted according to the layout of this template.

   For example, if your custom enter_bug template had a field
   <input type="text" name="buildid" size="30">

   and then your comment.txt.tmpl had
BuildID: [% form.buildid %]

   then something like
BuildID: 20020303

   would appear in the initial comment.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.2.6. Configuring Bugzilla to Detect the User's Language

   Bugzilla honours the user's Accept: HTTP header. You can install templates
   in other languages, and Bugzilla will pick the most appropriate according to
   a priority order defined by you. Many language templates can be obtained
   from http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html#localizations. Instructions for
   submitting new languages are also available from that location.

   After untarring the localizations (or creating your own) in the
   BUGZILLA_ROOT/template directory, you must update the languages parameter to
   contain any localizations you'd like to permit. You may also wish to set the
   defaultlanguage parameter to something other than "en" if you don't want
   English to be the default language.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.3. The Bugzilla Extension Mechanism

   Warning Custom extensions require Template Toolkit version 2.12 or above, or
      the application of a patch. See bug 239112 for details.

   Extensions are a way for extensions to Bugzilla to insert code into the
   standard Bugzilla templates and source files without modifying these files
   themselves. The extension mechanism defines a consistent API for extending
   the standard templates and source files in a way that cleanly separates
   standard code from extension code. Hooks reduce merge conflicts and make it
   easier to write extensions that work across multiple versions of Bugzilla,
   making upgrading a Bugzilla installation with installed extensions easier.
   Furthermore, they make it easy to install and remove extensions as each
   extension is nothing more than a simple directory structure.

   There are two main types of hooks: code hooks and template hooks. Code hooks
   allow extensions to invoke code at specific points in various source files,
   while template hooks allow extensions to add elements to the Bugzilla user
   interface.

   A hook is just a named place in a standard source or template file where
   extension source code or template files for that hook get processed. Each
   extension has a corresponding directory in the Bugzilla directory tree
   (BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/extension_name). Hooking an extension source file
   or template to a hook is as simple as putting the extension file into
   extension's template or code directory. When Bugzilla processes the source
   file or template and reaches the hook, it will process all extension files
   in the hook's directory. The hooks themselves can be added into any source
   file or standard template upon request by extension authors.

   To use hooks to extend Bugzilla, first make sure there is a hook at the
   appropriate place within the source file or template you want to extend. The
   exact appearance of a hook depends on if the hook is a code hook or a
   template hook.

   Code hooks appear in Bugzilla source files as a single method call in the
   format Bugzilla::Hook->process("name");. For instance, enter_bug.cgi may
   invoke the hook "enter_bug-entrydefaultvars". Thus, a source file at
   BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/EXTENSION_NAME/code/enter_bug-entrydefaultvars.pl
   will be automatically invoked when the code hook is reached.

   Template hooks appear in the standard Bugzilla templates as a single
   directive in the format [% Hook.process("name") %], where name is the unique
   name of the hook.

   If you aren't sure what you want to extend or just want to browse the
   available hooks, either use your favorite multi-file search tool (e.g. grep)
   to search the standard templates for occurrences of Hook.process or the
   source files for occurrences of Bugzilla::Hook::process.

   If there is no hook at the appropriate place within the Bugzilla source file
   or template you want to extend, file a bug requesting one, specifying:

   the source or template file for which you are requesting a hook;
   where in the file you would like the hook to be placed (line number/position
   for latest version of the file in CVS or description of location);
   the purpose of the hook;
   a link to information about your extension, if any.

   The Bugzilla reviewers will promptly review each hook request, name the
   hook, add it to the template or source file, and check the new version of
   the template into CVS.

   You may optionally attach a patch to the bug which implements the hook and
   check it in yourself after receiving approval from a Bugzilla reviewer. The
   developers may suggest changes to the location of the hook based on their
   analysis of your needs or so the hook can satisfy the needs of multiple
   extensions, but the process of getting hooks approved and checked in is not
   as stringent as the process for general changes to Bugzilla, and any
   extension, whether released or still in development, can have hooks added to
   meet their needs.

   After making sure the hook you need exists (or getting it added if not), add
   your extension to the directory within the Bugzilla extensions tree
   corresponding to the hook.

   That's it! Now, when the source file or template containing the hook is
   processed, your extension file will be processed at the point where the hook
   appears.

   For example, let's say you have an extension named Projman that adds project
   management capabilities to Bugzilla. Projman has an administration interface
   edit-projects.cgi, and you want to add a link to it into the navigation bar
   at the bottom of every Bugzilla page for those users who are authorized to
   administer projects.

   The navigation bar is generated by the template file useful-links.html.tmpl,
   which is located in the global/ subdirectory on the standard Bugzilla
   template path BUGZILLA_ROOT/template/en/default/. Looking in
   useful-links.html.tmpl, you find the following hook at the end of the list
   of standard Bugzilla administration links:
...
    [% ', <a href="editkeywords.cgi">keywords</a>'
                                              IF user.groups.editkeywords %]
    [% Hook.process("edit") %]
...

   The corresponding extension file for this hook is
   BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/projman/template/en/hook/global/useful-links-edit.h
   tml.tmpl. You then create that template file and add the following constant:
...[% ', <a href="edit-projects.cgi">projects</a>' IF user.groups.projman_admin
s %]

   Voila! The link now appears after the other administration links in the
   navigation bar for users in the projman_admins group.

   Now, let us say your extension adds a custom "project_manager" field to
   enter_bug.cgi. You want to modify the CGI script to set the default project
   manager to be productname@company.com. Looking at enter_bug.cgi, you see the
   enter_bug-entrydefaultvars hook near the bottom of the file before the
   default form values are set. The corresponding extension source file for
   this hook is located at
   BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/projman/code/enter_bug-entrydefaultvars.pl. You
   then create that file and add the following:
   $default{'project_manager'} = $product.'@company.com';

   This code will be invoked whenever enter_bug.cgi is executed. Assuming that
   the rest of the customization was completed (e.g. the custom field was added
   to the enter_bug template and the required hooks were used in
   process_bug.cgi), the new field will now have this default value.

   Notes:

     * If your extension includes entirely new templates in addition to
       extensions of standard templates, it should store those new templates in
       its BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/template/en/ directory. Extension template
       directories, like the default/ and custom/ directories, are part of the
       template search path, so putting templates there enables them to be
       found by the template processor.
       The template processor looks for templates first in the custom/
       directory (i.e. templates added by the specific installation), then in
       the extensions/ directory (i.e. templates added by extensions), and
       finally in the default/ directory (i.e. the standard Bugzilla
       templates). Thus, installation-specific templates override both default
       and extension templates.
     * If you are looking to customize Bugzilla, you can also take advantage of
       template hooks. To do so, create a directory in
       BUGZILLA_ROOT/template/en/custom/hook/ that corresponds to the hook you
       wish to use, then place your customization templates into those
       directories. For example, if you wanted to use the hook "end" in
       global/useful-links.html.tmpl, you would create the directory
       BUGZILLA_ROOT/template/en/custom/hook/
       global/useful-links.html.tmpl/end/ and add your customization template
       to this directory.
       Obviously this method of customizing Bugzilla only lets you add code to
       the standard source files and templates; you cannot change the existing
       code. Nevertheless, for those customizations that only add code, this
       method can reduce conflicts when merging changes, making upgrading your
       customized Bugzilla installation easier.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.4. Customizing Who Can Change What

   Warning This feature should be considered experimental; the Bugzilla code
   you will be changing is not stable, and could change or move between
   versions. Be aware that if you make modifications as outlined here, you may
   have to re-make them or port them if Bugzilla changes internally between
      versions, and you upgrade.

   Companies often have rules about which employees, or classes of employees,
   are allowed to change certain things in the bug system. For example, only
   the bug's designated QA Contact may be allowed to VERIFY the bug. Bugzilla
   has been designed to make it easy for you to write your own custom rules to
   define who is allowed to make what sorts of value transition.

   For maximum flexibility, customizing this means editing Bugzilla's Perl
   code. This gives the administrator complete control over exactly who is
   allowed to do what. The relevant method is called check_can_change_field(),
   and is found in Bug.pm in your Bugzilla/ directory. If you open that file
   and search for "sub check_can_change_field", you'll find it.

   This function has been carefully commented to allow you to see exactly how
   it works, and give you an idea of how to make changes to it. Certain marked
   sections should not be changed - these are the "plumbing" which makes the
   rest of the function work. In between those sections, you'll find snippets
   of code like:
    # Allow the assignee to change anything.
    if ($ownerid eq $whoid) {
        return 1;
    }

   It's fairly obvious what this piece of code does.

   So, how does one go about changing this function? Well, simple changes can
   be made just by removing pieces - for example, if you wanted to prevent any
   user adding a comment to a bug, just remove the lines marked "Allow anyone
   to change comments." If you don't want the Reporter to have any special
   rights on bugs they have filed, just remove the entire section that deals
   with the Reporter.

   More complex customizations are not much harder. Basically, you add a check
   in the right place in the function, i.e. after all the variables you are
   using have been set up. So, don't look at $ownerid before $ownerid has been
   obtained from the database. You can either add a positive check, which
   returns 1 (allow) if certain conditions are true, or a negative check, which
   returns 0 (deny.) E.g.:
    if ($field eq "qacontact") {
        if (Bugzilla->user->groups("quality_assurance")) {
            return 1;
        }
        else {
            return 0;
        }
    }

   This says that only users in the group "quality_assurance" can change the QA
   Contact field of a bug.

   Getting more weird:
    if (($field eq "priority") &&
        (Bugzilla->user->email =~ /.*\@example\.com$/))
    {
        if ($oldvalue eq "P1") {
            return 1;
        }
        else {
            return 0;
        }
    }

   This says that if the user is trying to change the priority field, and their
   email address is @example.com, they can only do so if the old value of the
   field was "P1". Not very useful, but illustrative.

   Warning If you are modifying process_bug.cgi in any way, do not change the
   code that is bounded by DO_NOT_CHANGE blocks. Doing so could compromise
      security, or cause your installation to stop working entirely.

   For a list of possible field names, look at the bugs table in the database.
   If you need help writing custom rules for your organization, ask in the
   newsgroup.

6.5. Integrating Bugzilla with Third-Party Tools

6.5.1. Bonsai

   Bonsai is a web-based tool for managing CVS, the Concurrent Versioning
   System . Using Bonsai, administrators can control open/closed status of
   trees, query a fast relational database back-end for change, branch, and
   comment information, and view changes made since the last time the tree was
   closed. Bonsai also integrates with Tinderbox, the Mozilla automated build
   management system.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.5.2. CVS

   CVS integration is best accomplished, at this point, using the Bugzilla
   Email Gateway.

   Follow the instructions in this Guide for enabling Bugzilla e-mail
   integration. Ensure that your check-in script sends an email to your
   Bugzilla e-mail gateway with the subject of "[Bug XXXX]", and you can have
   CVS check-in comments append to your Bugzilla bug. If you want to have the
   bug be closed automatically, you'll have to modify the
   contrib/bugzilla_email_append.pl script.

   There is also a CVSZilla project, based upon somewhat dated Bugzilla code,
   to integrate CVS and Bugzilla through CVS' ability to email. Check it out
   at: http://www.cvszilla.org/.

   Another system capable of CVS integration with Bugzilla is Scmbug. This
   system provides generic integration of Source code Configuration Management
   with Bugtracking. Check it out at: http://freshmeat.net/projects/scmbug/.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.5.3. Perforce SCM

   You can find the project page for Bugzilla and Teamtrack Perforce
   integration (p4dti) at: http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/p4dti/ . "p4dti"
   is now an officially supported product from Perforce, and you can find the
   "Perforce Public Depot" p4dti page at
   http://public.perforce.com/public/perforce/p4dti/index.html .

   Integration of Perforce with Bugzilla, once patches are applied, is
   seamless. Perforce replication information will appear below the comments of
   each bug. Be certain you have a matching set of patches for the Bugzilla
   version you are installing. p4dti is designed to support multiple defect
   trackers, and maintains its own documentation for it. Please consult the
   pages linked above for further information.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.5.4. Subversion

   Subversion is a free/open-source version control system, designed to
   overcome various limitations of CVS. Integration of Subversion with Bugzilla
   is possible using Scmbug, a system providing generic integration of Source
   Code Configuration Management with Bugtracking. Scmbug is available at
   http://freshmeat.net/projects/scmbug/.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.5.5. Tinderbox/Tinderbox2

   Tinderbox is a continuous-build system which can integrate with Bugzilla -
   see http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tinderbox for details of Tinderbox, and
   http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi to see it in action.

                or a specific operating system on your machine? 

        A.2.2. Does Bugzilla allow us to define our own priorities and levels?
                Do we have complete freedom to change the labels of fields and
                format of them, and the choice of acceptable values? 

        A.2.3. Does Bugzilla provide any reporting features, metrics, graphs,
                etc? You know, the type of stuff that management likes to see.
                :) 

        A.2.4. Is there email notification? If so, what do you see when you get
                an email? 

        A.2.5. Do users have to have any particular type of email application? 
        A.2.6. Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had
                outsiders write up a bug report using a MS Word bug template,
                could that template be imported into "matching" fields? If I
                wanted to take the results of a query and export that data to
                MS Excel, could I do that? 

        A.2.7. Has anyone converted Bugzilla to another language to be used in
                other countries? Is it localizable? 

        A.2.8. Can a user create and save reports? Can they do this in Word
                format? Excel format? 

        A.2.9. Are there any backup features provided? 
        A.2.10. What type of human resources are needed to be on staff to
                install and maintain Bugzilla? Specifically, what type of
                skills does the person need to have? I need to find out what
                types of individuals would we need to hire and how much would
                that cost if we were to go with Bugzilla vs. buying an
                "out-of-the-box" solution. 

        A.2.11. What time frame are we looking at if we decide to hire people
                to install and maintain the Bugzilla? Is this something that
                takes hours or days to install and a couple of hours per week
                to maintain and customize, or is this a multi-week install
                process, plus a full time job for 1 person, 2 people, etc? 

        A.2.12. Is there any licensing fee or other fees for using Bugzilla?
                Any out-of-pocket cost other than the bodies needed as
                identified above? 

        A.2.13. We don't like referring to problems as 'bugs'. Can we change
                that? 

   3. Administrative Questions

        A.3.1. Does Bugzilla provide record locking when there is simultaneous
                access to the same bug? Does the second person get a notice
                that the bug is in use or how are they notified? 

        A.3.2. Can users be on the system while a backup is in progress? 
        A.3.3. How can I update the code and the database using CVS? 
        A.3.4. How do I make it so that bugs can have an UNCONFIRMED status? 
        A.3.5. How do I move a Bugzilla installation from one machine to
                another? 

        A.3.6. How do I make a new Bugzilla administrator? The previous
                administrator is gone... 

   4. Bugzilla Security

        A.4.1. How do I completely disable MySQL security if it's giving me
                problems? (I've followed the instructions in the installation
                section of this guide...) 

        A.4.2. Are there any security problems with Bugzilla? 

   5. Bugzilla Email

        A.5.1. I have a user who doesn't want to receive any more email from
                Bugzilla. How do I stop it entirely for this user? 

        A.5.2. I'm evaluating/testing Bugzilla, and don't want it to send email
                to anyone but me. How do I do it? 

        A.5.3. I want whineatnews.pl to whine at something other than new and
                reopened bugs. How do I do it? 

        A.5.4. How do I set up the email interface to submit or change bugs via
                email? 

        A.5.5. Email takes FOREVER to reach me from Bugzilla -- it's extremely
                slow. What gives? 

        A.5.6. How come email from Bugzilla changes never reaches me? 

   6. Bugzilla Database

        A.6.1. I think my database might be corrupted, or contain invalid
                entries. What do I do? 

        A.6.2. I want to manually edit some entries in my database. How? 
        A.6.3. I think I've set up MySQL permissions correctly, but Bugzilla
                still can't connect. 

        A.6.4. How do I synchronize bug information among multiple different
                Bugzilla databases? 

   7. Can Bugzilla run on a Windows server?

        A.7.1. What is the easiest way to run Bugzilla on Win32 (Win98+/NT/2K)?
                
        A.7.2. Is there a "Bundle::Bugzilla" equivalent for Win32? 
        A.7.3. CGI's are failing with a "something.cgi is not a valid Windows
                NT application" error. Why? 

        A.7.4. I'm having trouble with the perl modules for NT not being able
                to talk to the database. 

   8. Bugzilla Usage

        A.8.1. How do I change my user name (email address) in Bugzilla? 
        A.8.2. The query page is very confusing. Isn't there a simpler way to
                query? 

        A.8.3. I'm confused by the behavior of the "Accept" button in the Show
                Bug form. Why doesn't it assign the bug to me when I accept it?
                
        A.8.4. I can't upload anything into the database via the "Create
                Attachment" link. What am I doing wrong? 

        A.8.5. How do I change a keyword in Bugzilla, once some bugs are using
                it? 

        A.8.6. Why can't I close bugs from the "Change Several Bugs at Once"
                page? 

   9. Bugzilla Hacking

        A.9.1. What kind of style should I use for templatization? 
        A.9.2. What bugs are in Bugzilla right now? 
        A.9.3. How can I change the default priority to a null value? For
                instance, have the default priority be "---" instead of "P2"? 

        A.9.4. What's the best way to submit patches? What guidelines should I
                follow? 

1. General Questions

   A.1.1. Can I try out Bugzilla somewhere?

   If you want to take a test ride, there are test installations at
   http://landfill.bugzilla.org/, ready to play with directly from your
   browser.

   A.1.2. What license is Bugzilla distributed under?

   Bugzilla is covered by the Mozilla Public License. See details at
   http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/.

   A.1.3. How do I get commercial support for Bugzilla?

   http://www.bugzilla.org/support/consulting.html is a list of companies and
   individuals who have asked us to list them as consultants for Bugzilla.

   There are several experienced Bugzilla hackers on the mailing list/newsgroup
   who are willing to make themselves available for generous compensation. Try
   sending a message to the mailing list asking for a volunteer.

   A.1.4. What major companies or projects are currently using Bugzilla for
   bug-tracking?

   There are dozens of major companies with public Bugzilla sites to track bugs
   in their products. We have a fairly complete list available on our website
   at http://bugzilla.org/installation-list/. If you have an installation of
   Bugzilla and would like to be added to the list, whether it's a public
   install or not, simply e-mail Gerv <gerv@mozilla.org>.

   A.1.5. Who maintains Bugzilla?

   A core team, led by Dave Miller (justdave@bugzilla.org).

   A.1.6. How does Bugzilla stack up against other bug-tracking databases?

   We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against other
   defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please get in touch. In the
   experience of Matthew Barnson (the original author of this FAQ), though,
   Bugzilla offers superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
   (free!), more developer-friendly features (such as stored queries, email
   integration, and platform independence), improved scalability, greater
   flexibility, and superior ease-of-use when compared to commercial
   bug-tracking software.

   If you happen to be a vendor for commercial bug-tracking software, and would
   like to submit a list of advantages your product has over Bugzilla, simply
   send it to <documentation@bugzilla.org> and we'd be happy to include the
   comparison in our documentation.

   A.1.7. Why doesn't Bugzilla offer this or that feature or compatibility with
   this other tracking software?

   It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you have not yet
   found it. While Bugzilla makes strides in usability, customizability,
   scalability, and user interface with each release, that doesn't mean it
   can't still use improvement!

   The best way to make an enhancement request is to file a bug at
   bugzilla.mozilla.org and set the Severity to 'enhancement'. Your 'request
   for enhancement' (RFE) will start out in the UNCONFIRMED state, and will
   stay there until someone with the ability to CONFIRM the bug reviews it. If
   that person feels it to be a good request that fits in with Bugzilla's
   overall direction, the status will be changed to NEW; if not, they will
   probably explain why and set the bug to RESOLVED/WONTFIX. If someone else
   has made the same (or almost the same) request before, your request will be
   marked RESOLVED/DUPLICATE, and a pointer to the previous RFE will be added.

   Even if your RFE gets approved, that doesn't mean it's going to make it
   right into the next release; there are a limited number of developers, and a
   whole lot of RFEs... some of which are quite complex. If you're a
   code-hacking sort of person, you can help the project along by making a
   patch yourself that supports the functionality you require. If you have
   never contributed anything to Bugzilla before, please be sure to read the
   Developers' Guide and Contributors' Guide before going ahead.

   A.1.8. What databases does Bugzilla run on?

   MySQL is the default database for Bugzilla. It was originally chosen because
   it is free, easy to install, and was available for the hardware Netscape
   intended to run it on.

   As of Bugzilla 2.22, complete support for PostgreSQL is included. With this
   release using PostgreSQL with Bugzilla should be as stable as using MySQL.
   If you experience any problems with PostgreSQL compatibility, they will be
   taken as seriously as if you were running MySQL.

   There are plans to include an Oracle driver for Bugzilla 3.1.2. Track
   progress at Bug 189947.

   Sybase support was worked on for a time. However, several complicating
   factors have prevented Sybase support from being realized. There are
   currently no plans to revive it.

   Bug 237862 is a good bug to read through if you'd like to see what progress
   is being made on general database compatibility.

   A.1.9. My perl is located at /usr/local/bin/perl and not /usr/bin/perl. Is
   there an easy to change that in all the files that have this hard-coded?

   The easiest way to get around this is to create a link from one to the
   other: ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl. If that's not an option for
   you, the following bit of perl magic will change all the shebang lines (that
   is to say, the line at the top of each file that starts with '#!' and
   contains the path) to something else:
perl -pi -e 's@#\!/usr/bin/perl@#\!/usr/local/bin/perl@' *cgi *pl

   Sadly, this command-line won't work on Windows unless you also have Cygwin.
   However, MySQL comes with a binary called replace which can do the job:
C:\mysql\bin\replace "#!/usr/bin/perl" "#!C:\perl\bin\perl" -- *.cgi *.pl

   Note If your perl path is something else again, just follow the above
      examples and replace /usr/local/bin/perl with your own perl path.

   Once you've modified all your files, you'll also need to modify the
   t/002goodperl.t test, as it tests that all shebang lines are equal to
   /usr/bin/perl. (For more information on the test suite, please check out the
   appropriate section in the Developers' Guide.) Having done this, run the
   test itself:
            perl runtests.pl 2 --verbose

   to ensure that you've modified all the relevant files.

   If using Apache on Windows, you can avoid the whole problem by setting the
   ScriptInterpreterSource directive to 'Registry'. (If using Apache 2 or
   higher, set it to 'Registry-Strict'.) ScriptInterperterSource requires a
   registry entry "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cgi\Shell\ExecCGI\Command" to associate
   .cgi files with your perl executable. If one does not already exist, create
   it with a default value of "<full path to perl> -T", e.g.
   "C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -T".

   A.1.10. Is there an easy way to change the Bugzilla cookie name?

   At present, no.

   A.1.11. How can Bugzilla be made to work under SELinux?

   As a web application, Bugzilla simply requires its root directory to have
   the httpd context applied for it to work properly under SELinux. This should
   happen automatically on distributions that use SELinux and that package
   Bugzilla (if it is installed with the native package management tools).
   Information on how to view and change SELinux file contexts can be found at
   the SELinux FAQ.

2. Managerial Questions

   A.2.1. Is Bugzilla web-based, or do you have to have specific software or a
   specific operating system on your machine?

   It is web and e-mail based.

   A.2.2. Does Bugzilla allow us to define our own priorities and levels? Do we
   have complete freedom to change the labels of fields and format of them, and
   the choice of acceptable values?

   Yes. However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug
   progression states, also require adjusting the program logic to compensate
   for the change.

   As of Bugzilla 3.0 custom fields can be created via the "Custom Fields"
   admin page.

   A.2.3. Does Bugzilla provide any reporting features, metrics, graphs, etc?
   You know, the type of stuff that management likes to see. :)

   Yes. Look at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/report.cgi for samples of what
   Bugzilla can do in reporting and graphing. Fuller documentation is provided
   in Section 5.11.

   If you can not get the reports you want from the included reporting scripts,
   it is possible to hook up a professional reporting package such as Crystal
   Reports using ODBC. If you choose to do this, beware that giving direct
   access to the database does contain some security implications. Even if you
   give read-only access to the bugs database it will bypass the secure bugs
   features of Bugzilla.

   A.2.4. Is there email notification? If so, what do you see when you get an
   email?

   Email notification is user-configurable. By default, the bug id and summary
   of the bug report accompany each email notification, along with a list of
   the changes made.

   A.2.5. Do users have to have any particular type of email application?

   Bugzilla email is sent in plain text, the most compatible mail format on the
   planet.

   Note If you decide to use the bugzilla_email integration features to allow
   Bugzilla to record responses to mail with the associated bug, you may need
   to caution your users to set their mailer to "respond to messages in the
   format in which they were sent". For security reasons Bugzilla ignores HTML
   tags in comments, and if a user sends HTML-based email into Bugzilla the
      resulting comment looks downright awful.

   A.2.6. Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had
   outsiders write up a bug report using a MS Word bug template, could that
   template be imported into "matching" fields? If I wanted to take the results
   of a query and export that data to MS Excel, could I do that?

   Bugzilla can output buglists as HTML (the default), CSV or RDF. The link for
   CSV can be found at the bottom of the buglist in HTML format. This CSV
   format can easily be imported into MS Excel or other spreadsheet
   applications.

   To use the RDF format of the buglist it is necessary to append a &ctype=rdf
   to the URL. RDF is meant to be machine readable and thus it is assumed that
   the URL would be generated programmatically so there is no user visible link
   to this format.

   Currently the only script included with Bugzilla that can import data is
   importxml.pl which is intended to be used for importing the data generated
   by the XML ctype of show_bug.cgi in association with bug moving. Any other
   use is left as an exercise for the user.

   There are also scripts included in the contrib/ directory for using e-mail
   to import information into Bugzilla, but these scripts are not currently
   supported and included for educational purposes.

   A.2.7. Has anyone converted Bugzilla to another language to be used in other
   countries? Is it localizable?

   Yes. For more information including available translated templates, see
   http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html#localizations. Some admin interfaces
   have been templatized (for easy localization) but many of them are still
   available in English only. Also, there may be issues with the charset not
   being declared. See bug 126226 for more information.

   A.2.8. Can a user create and save reports? Can they do this in Word format?
   Excel format?

   Yes. No. Yes (using the CSV format).

   A.2.9. Are there any backup features provided?

   You should use the backup options supplied by your database platform. Vendor
   documentation for backing up a MySQL database can be found at
   http://www.mysql.com/doc/B/a/Backup.html. PostgreSQL backup documentation
   can be found at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/backup.html.

   A.2.10. What type of human resources are needed to be on staff to install
   and maintain Bugzilla? Specifically, what type of skills does the person
   need to have? I need to find out what types of individuals would we need to
   hire and how much would that cost if we were to go with Bugzilla vs. buying
   an "out-of-the-box" solution.

   If Bugzilla is set up correctly from the start, continuing maintenance needs
   are minimal and can be done easily using the web interface.

   Commercial Bug-tracking software typically costs somewhere upwards of
   $20,000 or more for 5-10 floating licenses. Bugzilla consultation is
   available from skilled members of the newsgroup. Simple questions are
   answered there and then.

   A.2.11. What time frame are we looking at if we decide to hire people to
   install and maintain the Bugzilla? Is this something that takes hours or
   days to install and a couple of hours per week to maintain and customize, or
   is this a multi-week install process, plus a full time job for 1 person, 2
   people, etc?

   It all depends on your level of commitment. Someone with much Bugzilla
   experience can get you up and running in less than a day, and your Bugzilla
   install can run untended for years. If your Bugzilla strategy is critical to
   your business workflow, hire somebody to who has reasonable Perl skills, and
   a familiarity with the operating system on which Bugzilla will be running,
   and have them handle your process management, bug-tracking maintenance, and
   local customization.

   A.2.12. Is there any licensing fee or other fees for using Bugzilla? Any
   out-of-pocket cost other than the bodies needed as identified above?

   No. Bugzilla, Perl, the Template Toolkit, and all other support software
   needed to make Bugzilla work can be downloaded for free. MySQL and
   PostgreSQL -- the databases supported by Bugzilla -- are also open-source.
   MySQL asks that if you find their product valuable, you purchase a support
   contract from them that suits your needs.

   A.2.13. We don't like referring to problems as 'bugs'. Can we change that?

   Yes! As of Bugzilla 2.18, it is a simple matter to change the word 'bug'
   into whatever word/phrase is used by your organization. See the
   documentation on Customization for more details, specifically Section 6.2.5.

3. Administrative Questions

   A.3.1. Does Bugzilla provide record locking when there is simultaneous
   access to the same bug? Does the second person get a notice that the bug is
   in use or how are they notified?

   Bugzilla does not lock records. It provides mid-air collision detection --
   which means that it warns a user when a commit is about to conflict with
   commits recently made by another user, and offers the second user a choice
   of options to deal with the conflict.

   A.3.2. Can users be on the system while a backup is in progress?

   Refer to your database platform documentation for details on how to do hot
   backups. Vendor documentation for backing up a MySQL database can be found
   at http://www.mysql.com/doc/B/a/Backup.html. PostgreSQL backup documentation
   can be found at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/backup.html.

   A.3.3. How can I update the code and the database using CVS?

    1. Make a backup of both your Bugzilla directory and the database. For the
       Bugzilla directory this is as easy as doing cp -rp bugzilla
       bugzilla.bak. For the database, there's a number of options - see the
       MySQL docs and pick the one that fits you best (the easiest is to just
       make a physical copy of the database on the disk, but you have to have
       the database server shut down to do that without risking dataloss).
    2. Make the Bugzilla directory your current directory.
    3. Use cvs -q update -AdP if you want to update to the tip or cvs -q update
       -dP -rTAGNAME if you want a specific version (in that case you'll have
       to replace TAGNAME with a CVS tag name such as BUGZILLA-2_16_5).
       If you've made no local changes, this should be very clean. If you have
       made local changes, then watch the cvs output for C results. If you get
       any lines that start with a C it means there were conflicts between your
       local changes and what's in CVS. You'll need to fix those manually
       before continuing.
    4. After resolving any conflicts that the cvs update operation generated,
       running ./checksetup.pl will take care of updating the database for you
       as well as any other changes required for the new version to operate.

      Warning Once you run checksetup.pl, the only way to go back is to restore
   the database backups. You can't "downgrade" the system cleanly under most
      circumstances.

   See also the instructions in Section 3.14.3.1.

   A.3.4. How do I make it so that bugs can have an UNCONFIRMED status?

   To use the UNCONFIRMED status, you must have the 'usevotes' parameter set to
   "On". You must then visit the editproducts.cgi page and set the " Number of
   votes a bug in this product needs to automatically get out of the
   UNCONFIRMED state" to be a non-zero number. (You will have to do this for
   each product that wants to use the UNCONFIRMED state.) If you do not
   actually want users to be able to vote for bugs entered against this
   product, leave the "Maximum votes per person" value at '0'.

   There is work being done to decouple the UNCONFIRMED state from the
   'usevotes' parameter for future versions of Bugzilla. Follow the discussion
   and progress at bug 162060.

   A.3.5. How do I move a Bugzilla installation from one machine to another?

   Reference your database vendor's documentation for information on backing up
   and restoring your Bugzilla database on to a different server. Vendor
   documentation for backing up a MySQL database can be found at
   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/mysqldump.html. PostgreSQL backup
   documentation can be found at
   http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/backup.html.

   On your new machine, follow the instructions found in Chapter 2 as far as
   setting up the physical environment of the new machine with perl, webserver,
   modules, etc. Having done that, you can either: copy your entire Bugzilla
   directory from the old machine to a new one (if you want to keep your
   existing code and modifications), or download a newer version (if you are
   planning to upgrade at the same time). Even if you are upgrading to clean
   code, you will still want to bring over the localconfig file, and the data
   directory from the old machine, as they contain configuration information
   that you probably won't want to re-create.

   Note If the hostname or port number of your database server changed as part
   of the move, you'll need to update the appropriate variables in localconfig
      before taking the next step.

   Once you have your code in place, and your database has been restored from
   the backup you made in step 1, run checksetup.pl. This will upgrade your
   database (if necessary), rebuild your templates, etc.

   A.3.6. How do I make a new Bugzilla administrator? The previous
   administrator is gone...

   Run checksetup.pl with --make-admin option. Its usage is
   --make-admin=user@example.org. The user account must be exist in the
   Bugzilla database.

4. Bugzilla Security

   A.4.1. How do I completely disable MySQL security if it's giving me
   problems? (I've followed the instructions in the installation section of
   this guide...)

   You can run MySQL like this: mysqld --skip-grant-tables. However, doing so
   disables all MySQL security. This is a bad idea. Please consult Section 4.2
   of this guide and the MySQL documentation for better solutions.

   A.4.2. Are there any security problems with Bugzilla?

   The Bugzilla code has undergone a reasonably complete security audit, and
   user-facing CGIs run under Perl's taint mode. However, it is recommended
   that you closely examine permissions on your Bugzilla installation, and
   follow the recommended security guidelines found in The Bugzilla Guide.

5. Bugzilla Email

   A.5.1. I have a user who doesn't want to receive any more email from
   Bugzilla. How do I stop it entirely for this user?

   The user can stop Bugzilla from sending any mail by unchecking all boxes on
   the 'Edit prefs' -> 'Email settings' page. (As of 2.18,this is made easier
   by the addition of a 'Disable All Mail' button.) Alternately, you can add
   their email address to the data/nomail file (one email address per line).
   This will override their personal preferences, and they will never be sent
   mail again.

   A.5.2. I'm evaluating/testing Bugzilla, and don't want it to send email to
   anyone but me. How do I do it?

   To disable email, set the mail_delivery_method parameter to none (2.20 and
   later), or
   $enableSendMail

   parameter to '0' in either BugMail.pm (2.18 and later) or processmail (up to
   2.16.x).

   Note Up to 2.16.x, changing
   $enableSendMail

   will only affect bugmail; email related to password changes, email address
   changes, bug imports, flag changes, etc. will still be sent out. As of the
   final release of 2.18, however, the above step will disable all mail sent
   from Bugzilla for any purpose.

   To have bugmail (and only bugmail) redirected to you instead of its intended
   recipients, leave
   $enableSendMail

   alone; instead, edit the "newchangedmail" parameter as follows:

     * Replace "To:" with "X-Real-To:"
     * Replace "Cc:" with "X-Real-CC:"
     * Add a "To: %lt;your_email_address>"

   A.5.3. I want whineatnews.pl to whine at something other than new and
   reopened bugs. How do I do it?

   For older versions of Bugzilla, you may be able to apply Klaas Freitag's
   patch for "whineatassigned", which can be found in bug 6679. Note that this
   patch was made in 2000, so it may take some work to apply cleanly to any
   releases of Bugzilla newer than that, but you can use it as a starting
   point.

   An updated (and much-expanded) version of this functionality is due to be
   released as part of Bugzilla 2.20; see bug 185090 for the discussion, and
   for more up-to-date patches if you just can't wait.

   A.5.4. How do I set up the email interface to submit or change bugs via
   email?

   Bugzilla 3.0 and later offers the ability submit or change bugs via email,
   using the email_in.pl script within the root directory of the Bugzilla
   installation. More information on the script can be found in
   docs/html/api/email_in.html.

   A.5.5. Email takes FOREVER to reach me from Bugzilla -- it's extremely slow.
   What gives?

   If you are using sendmail, try enabling sendmailnow in editparams.cgi. For
   earlier versions of sendmail, one could achieve significant performance
   improvement in the UI (at the cost of delaying the sending of mail) by
   setting this parameter to off. Sites with sendmail version 8.12 (or higher)
   should leave this on, as they will not see any performance benefit.

   If you are using an alternate MTA, make sure the options given in
   Bugzilla/BugMail.pm and any other place where sendmail is called are correct
   for your MTA.

   A.5.6. How come email from Bugzilla changes never reaches me?

   Double-check that you have not turned off email in your user preferences.
   Confirm that Bugzilla is able to send email by visiting the "Log In" link of
   your Bugzilla installation and clicking the "Submit Request" button after
   entering your email address.

   If you never receive mail from Bugzilla, chances are you do not have
   sendmail in "/usr/lib/sendmail". Ensure sendmail lives in, or is symlinked
   to, "/usr/lib/sendmail".

   If you are using an MTA other than sendmail the sendmailnow param must be
   set to on or no mail will be sent.

6. Bugzilla Database

   A.6.1. I think my database might be corrupted, or contain invalid entries.
   What do I do?

   Run the "sanity check" utility (sanitycheck.cgi) from your web browser to
   see! If it finishes without errors, you're probably OK. If it doesn't come
   back OK (i.e. any red letters), there are certain things Bugzilla can
   recover from and certain things it can't. If it can't auto-recover, I hope
   you're familiar with mysqladmin commands or have installed another way to
   manage your database. Sanity Check, although it is a good basic check on
   your database integrity, by no means is a substitute for competent database
   administration and avoiding deletion of data. It is not exhaustive, and was
   created to do a basic check for the most common problems in Bugzilla
   databases.

   A.6.2. I want to manually edit some entries in my database. How?

   There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally not
   a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what you're doing. If you
   understand SQL, though, you can use the mysql or psql command line utilities
   to manually insert, delete and modify table information. There are also more
   intuitive GUI clients available for both MySQL and PostgreSQL. For MySQL, we
   recommend phpMyAdmin.

   Remember, backups are your friend. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's nice to
   have a safety net in case you mess something up.

   A.6.3. I think I've set up MySQL permissions correctly, but Bugzilla still
   can't connect.

   Try running MySQL from its binary: mysqld --skip-grant-tables. This will
   allow you to completely rule out grant tables as the cause of your
   frustration. If this Bugzilla is able to connect at this point then you need
   to check that you have granted proper permission to the user password combo
   defined in localconfig.

   Warning Running MySQL with this command line option is very insecure and
   should only be done when not connected to the external network as a
   troubleshooting step. Please do not run your production database in this
      mode.

   You may also be suffering from a client version mismatch:

   MySQL 4.1 and up uses an authentication protocol based on a password hashing
   algorithm that is incompatible with that used by older clients. If you
   upgrade the server to 4.1, attempts to connect to it with an older client
   may fail with the following message:

shell> mysql
            Client does not support authentication protocol requested
            by server; consider upgrading MySQL client

   To solve this problem, you should use one of the following approaches:

     * Upgrade all client programs to use a 4.1.1 or newer client library.
     * When connecting to the server with a pre-4.1 client program, use an
       account that still has a pre-4.1-style password.
     * Reset the password to pre-4.1 style for each user that needs to use a
       pre-4.1 client program. This can be done using the SET PASSWORD
       statement and the OLD_PASSWORD() function:

                    mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR
                        -> ' some_user '@' some_host ' = OLD_PASSWORD(' newpwd
   ');

   A.6.4. How do I synchronize bug information among multiple different
   Bugzilla databases?

   Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs. Synchronization will only
   work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database at one site,
   and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main database.

   MySQL has some synchronization features built-in to the latest releases. It
   would be great if someone looked into the possibilities there and provided a
   report to the newsgroup on how to effectively synchronize two Bugzilla
   installations.

   If you simply need to transfer bugs from one Bugzilla to another, checkout
   the "move.pl" script in the Bugzilla distribution.

7. Can Bugzilla run on a Windows server?

   A.7.1. What is the easiest way to run Bugzilla on Win32 (Win98+/NT/2K)?

   Making Bugzilla work easily with Windows was one of the major goals of the
   2.18 milestone. If the necessary components are in place (perl, a webserver,
   an MTA, etc.) then installation of Bugzilla on a Windows box should be no
   more difficult than on any other platform. As with any installation, we
   recommend that you carefully and completely follow the installation
   instructions in Section 2.5.1.

   While doing so, don't forget to check out the very excellent guide to
   Installing Bugzilla on Microsoft Windows written by Byron Jones. Thanks,
   Byron!

   A.7.2. Is there a "Bundle::Bugzilla" equivalent for Win32?

   Not currently. Bundle::Bugzilla enormously simplifies Bugzilla installation
   on UNIX systems. If someone can volunteer to create a suitable PPM bundle
   for Win32, it would be appreciated.

   A.7.3. CGI's are failing with a "something.cgi is not a valid Windows NT
   application" error. Why?

   Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure the
   Web server to treat *.cgi files as CGI scripts. In IIS, you do this by
   adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with the <path>\perl.exe %s %s as the
   executable.

   Microsoft has some advice on this matter, as well:

     "Set application mappings. In the ISM, map the extension for the script
     file(s) to the executable for the script interpreter. For example, you
     might map the extension .py to Python.exe, the executable for the Python
     script interpreter. Note For the ActiveState Perl script interpreter, the
     extension '.pl' is associated with PerlIS.dll by default. If you want to
     change the association of .pl to perl.exe, you need to change the
     application mapping. In the mapping, you must add two percent (%)
     characters to the end of the pathname for perl.exe, as shown in this
     example: c:\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s"

   A.7.4. I'm having trouble with the perl modules for NT not being able to
   talk to the database.

   Your modules may be outdated or inaccurate. Try:

    1. Hitting http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl
    2. Download ActivePerl
    3. Go to your prompt
    4. Type 'ppm'
    5. PPM> install DBI DBD-mysql GD

   I reckon TimeDate comes with the activeperl. You can check the ActiveState
   site for packages for installation through PPM.
   http://www.activestate.com/Packages/.

8. Bugzilla Usage

   A.8.1. How do I change my user name (email address) in Bugzilla?

   You can change your email address from the Name and Password section in
   Preferences. You will be emailed at both the old and new addresses for
   confirmation. 'Administrative Policies' must have the 'allowemailchange'
   parameter set to "On".

   A.8.2. The query page is very confusing. Isn't there a simpler way to query?

   The interface was simplified by a UI designer for 2.16. Further suggestions
   for improvement are welcome, but we won't sacrifice power for simplicity.

   As of 2.18, there is also a 'simpler' search available. At the top of the
   search page are two links; "Advanced Search" will take you to the familiar
   full-power/full-complexity search page. The "Find a Specific Bug" link will
   take you to a much-simplified page where you can pick a product and status
   (open,closed, or both), then enter words that appear in the bug you want to
   find. This search will scour the 'Summary' and 'Comment' fields, and return
   a list of bugs sorted so that the bugs with the most hits/matches are nearer
   to the top.

   Note Matches in the Summary will 'trump' matches in comments, and bugs with
   summary-matches will be placed higher in the buglist -- even if a
      lower-ranked bug has more matches in the comments section.

   Bugzilla uses a cookie to remember which version of the page you visited
   last, and brings that page up when you next do a search. The default page
   for new users (or after an upgrade) is the 'simple' search.

   A.8.3. I'm confused by the behavior of the "Accept" button in the Show Bug
   form. Why doesn't it assign the bug to me when I accept it?

   The current behavior is acceptable to bugzilla.mozilla.org and most users.
   If you want to change this behavior, though, you have your choice of
   patches:

   Bug 35195 seeks to add an "...and accept the bug" checkbox to the UI. It has
   two patches attached to it: attachment 8029 was originally created for
   Bugzilla 2.12, while attachment 91372 is an updated version for Bugzilla
   2.16
   Bug 37613 also provides two patches (against Bugzilla 2.12): one to add a
   'Take Bug' option, and the other to automatically reassign the bug on
   'Accept'.

   These patches are all somewhat dated now, and cannot be applied directly,
   but they are simple enough to provide a guide on how Bugzilla can be
   customized and updated to suit your needs.

   A.8.4. I can't upload anything into the database via the "Create Attachment"
   link. What am I doing wrong?

   The most likely cause is a very old browser or a browser that is
   incompatible with file upload via POST. Download the latest version of your
   favourite browser to handle uploads correctly.

   A.8.5. How do I change a keyword in Bugzilla, once some bugs are using it?

   In the Bugzilla administrator UI, edit the keyword and it will let you
   replace the old keyword name with a new one. This will cause a problem with
   the keyword cache; run sanitycheck.cgi to fix it.

   A.8.6. Why can't I close bugs from the "Change Several Bugs at Once" page?

   Simple answer; you can.

   The logic behind the page checks every bug in the list to determine legal
   state changes, and then only shows you controls to do things that could
   apply to every bug on the list. The reason for this is that if you try to do
   something illegal to a bug, the whole process will grind to a halt, and all
   changes after the failed one will also fail. Since that isn't a good
   outcome, the page doesn't even present you with the option.

   In practical terms, that means that in order to mark multiple bugs as
   CLOSED, then every bug on the page has to be either RESOLVED or VERIFIED
   already; if this is not the case, then the option to close the bugs will not
   appear on the page.

   The rationale is that if you pick one of the bugs that's not VERIFIED and
   try to CLOSE it, the bug change will fail miserably (thus killing any
   changes in the list after it while doing the bulk change) so it doesn't even
   give you the choice.

9. Bugzilla Hacking

   A.9.1. What kind of style should I use for templatization?

   Gerv and Myk suggest a 2-space indent, with embedded code sections on their
   own line, in line with outer tags. Like this:
<fred>
[% IF foo %]
  <bar>
  [% FOREACH x = barney %]
    <tr>
      <td>
        [% x %]
      </td>
    <tr>
  [% END %]
[% END %]
</fred>

   Myk also recommends you turn on PRE_CHOMP in the template initialization to
   prevent bloating of HTML with unnecessary whitespace.

   Please note that many have differing opinions on this subject, and the
   existing templates in Bugzilla espouse both this and a 4-space style. Either
   is acceptable; the above is preferred.

   A.9.2. What bugs are in Bugzilla right now?

   Try this link to view current bugs or requests for enhancement for Bugzilla.

   You can view bugs marked for 3.2 release here. This list includes bugs for
   the 3.2 release that have already been fixed and checked into CVS. Please
   consult the Bugzilla Project Page for details on how to check current
   sources out of CVS so you can have these bug fixes early!

   A.9.3. How can I change the default priority to a null value? For instance,
   have the default priority be "---" instead of "P2"?

   This is well-documented in bug 49862. Ultimately, it's as easy as adding the
   "---" priority field to your localconfig file in the appropriate area,
   re-running checksetup.pl, and then changing the default priority in your
   browser using editparams.cgi.

   A.9.4. What's the best way to submit patches? What guidelines should I
   follow?

    1. Enter a bug into bugzilla.mozilla.org for the "Bugzilla" product.
    2. Upload your patch as a unified diff (having used "diff -u" against the
       current sources checked out of CVS), or new source file by clicking
       "Create a new attachment" link on the bug page you've just created, and
       include any descriptions of database changes you may make, into the bug
       ID you submitted in step #1. Be sure and click the "Patch" checkbox to
       indicate the text you are sending is a patch!
    3. Announce your patch and the associated URL
       (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXXX) for discussion in
       the newsgroup (mozilla.support.bugzilla). You'll get a really good,
       fairly immediate reaction to the implications of your patch, which will
       also give us an idea how well-received the change would be.
    4. If it passes muster with minimal modification, the person to whom the
       bug is assigned in Bugzilla is responsible for seeing the patch is
       checked into CVS.
    5. Bask in the glory of the fact that you helped write the most successful
       open-source bug-tracking software on the planet :)
     _________________________________________________________________

Appendix B. Troubleshooting

   This section gives solutions to common Bugzilla installation problems. If
   none of the section headings seems to match your problem, read the general
   advice.
     _________________________________________________________________

B.1. General Advice

   If you can't get checksetup.pl to run to completion, it normally explains
   what's wrong and how to fix it. If you can't work it out, or if it's being
   uncommunicative, post the errors in the mozilla.support.bugzilla newsgroup.

   If you have made it all the way through Section 2.1 (Installation) and
   Section 2.2 (Configuration) but accessing the Bugzilla URL doesn't work, the
   first thing to do is to check your webserver error log. For Apache, this is
   often located at /etc/logs/httpd/error_log. The error messages you see may
   be self-explanatory enough to enable you to diagnose and fix the problem. If
   not, see below for some commonly-encountered errors. If that doesn't help,
   post the errors to the newsgroup.

   Bugzilla can also log all user-based errors (and many code-based errors)
   that occur, without polluting the web server error log. To enable Bugzilla
   error logging, create a file that Bugzilla can write to, named errorlog, in
   the Bugzilla data directory. Errors will be logged as they occur, and will
   include the type of the error, the IP address and username (if available) of
   the user who triggered the error, and the values of all environment
   variables; if a form was being submitted, the data in the form will also be
   included. To disable error logging, delete or rename the errorlog file.
     _________________________________________________________________

B.2. The Apache webserver is not serving Bugzilla pages

   After you have run checksetup.pl twice, run testserver.pl
   http://yoursite.yourdomain/yoururl to confirm that your webserver is
   configured properly for Bugzilla.
bash$ ./testserver.pl http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip
TEST-OK Webserver is running under group id in $webservergroup.
TEST-OK Got ant picture.
TEST-OK Webserver is executing CGIs.
TEST-OK Webserver is preventing fetch of http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-
tip/localconfig.
     _________________________________________________________________

B.3. I installed a Perl module, but checksetup.pl claims it's not installed!

   This could be caused by one of two things:

    1. You have two versions of Perl on your machine. You are installing
       modules into one, and Bugzilla is using the other. Rerun the CPAN
       commands (or manual compile) using the full path to Perl from the top of
       checksetup.pl. This will make sure you are installing the modules in the
       right place.
    2. The permissions on your library directories are set incorrectly. They
       must, at the very least, be readable by the webserver user or group. It
       is recommended that they be world readable.
     _________________________________________________________________

B.4. DBD::Sponge::db prepare failed

   The following error message may appear due to a bug in DBD::mysql (over
   which the Bugzilla team have no control):
 DBD::Sponge::db prepare failed: Cannot determine NUM_OF_FIELDS at D:/Perl/site
/lib/DBD/mysql.pm line 248.
  SV = NULL(0x0) at 0x20fc444
  REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (PADBUSY,PADMY)

   To fix this, go to <path-to-perl>/lib/DBD/sponge.pm in your Perl
   installation and replace
 my $numFields;
 if ($attribs->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'}) {
     $numFields = $attribs->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'};
 } elsif ($attribs->{'NAME'}) {
     $numFields = @{$attribs->{NAME}};

   with
 my $numFields;
 if ($attribs->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'}) {
     $numFields = $attribs->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'};
 } elsif ($attribs->{'NAMES'}) {
     $numFields = @{$attribs->{NAMES}};

   (note the S added to NAME.)
     _________________________________________________________________

B.5. cannot chdir(/var/spool/mqueue)

   If you are installing Bugzilla on SuSE Linux, or some other distributions
   with "paranoid" security options, it is possible that the checksetup.pl
   script may fail with the error:
   cannot chdir(/var/spool/mqueue): Permission denied

   This is because your /var/spool/mqueue directory has a mode of drwx------.
   Type chmod 755 /var/spool/mqueue as root to fix this problem. This will
   allow any process running on your machine the ability to read the
   /var/spool/mqueue directory.
     _________________________________________________________________

B.6. Everybody is constantly being forced to relogin

   The most-likely cause is that the "cookiepath" parameter is not set
   correctly in the Bugzilla configuration. You can change this (if you're a
   Bugzilla administrator) from the editparams.cgi page via the web.

   The value of the cookiepath parameter should be the actual directory
   containing your Bugzilla installation, as seen by the end-user's web
   browser. Leading and trailing slashes are mandatory. You can also set the
   cookiepath to any directory which is a parent of the Bugzilla directory
   (such as '/', the root directory). But you can't put something that isn't at
   least a partial match or it won't work. What you're actually doing is
   restricting the end-user's browser to sending the cookies back only to that
   directory.

   How do you know if you want your specific Bugzilla directory or the whole
   site?

   If you have only one Bugzilla running on the server, and you don't mind
   having other applications on the same server with it being able to see the
   cookies (you might be doing this on purpose if you have other things on your
   site that share authentication with Bugzilla), then you'll want to have the
   cookiepath set to "/", or to a sufficiently-high enough directory that all
   of the involved apps can see the cookies.

   Example B-1. Examples of urlbase/cookiepath pairs for sharing login cookies

             urlbase is http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
             cookiepath is /
             urlbase is http://tools.mysite.tld/bugzilla/
                     but you have http://tools.mysite.tld/someotherapp/ which s
     hares
                     authentication with your Bugzilla
             cookiepath is /

   On the other hand, if you have more than one Bugzilla running on the server
   (some people do - we do on landfill) then you need to have the cookiepath
   restricted enough so that the different Bugzillas don't confuse their
   cookies with one another.

   Example B-2. Examples of urlbase/cookiepath pairs to restrict the login
   cookie

             urlbase is http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/
             cookiepath is /bugzilla-tip/
             urlbase is http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-2.16-branch/
             cookiepath is /bugzilla-2.16-branch/

   If you had cookiepath set to "/" at any point in the past and need to set it
   to something more restrictive (i.e. "/bugzilla/"), you can safely do this
   without requiring users to delete their Bugzilla-related cookies in their
   browser (this is true starting with Bugzilla 2.18 and Bugzilla 2.16.5).
     _________________________________________________________________

B.7. Some users are constantly being forced to relogin

   First, make sure cookies are enabled in the user's browser.

   If that doesn't fix the problem, it may be that the user's ISP implements a
   rotating proxy server. This causes the user's effective IP address (the
   address which the Bugzilla server perceives him coming from) to change
   periodically. Since Bugzilla cookies are tied to a specific IP address, each
   time the effective address changes, the user will have to log in again.

   If you are using 2.18 (or later), there is a parameter called
   "loginnetmask", which you can use to set the number of bits of the user's IP
   address to require to be matched when authenticating the cookies. If you set
   this to something less than 32, then the user will be given a checkbox for
   "Restrict this login to my IP address" on the login screen, which defaults
   to checked. If they leave the box checked, Bugzilla will behave the same as
   it did before, requiring an exact match on their IP address to remain logged
   in. If they uncheck the box, then only the left side of their IP address (up
   to the number of bits you specified in the parameter) has to match to remain
   logged in.
     _________________________________________________________________

B.8. index.cgi doesn't show up unless specified in the URL

   You probably need to set up your web server in such a way that it will serve
   the index.cgi page as an index page.

   If you are using Apache, you can do this by adding index.cgi to the end of
   the DirectoryIndex line as mentioned in Section 2.2.4.1.
     _________________________________________________________________

B.9. checksetup.pl reports "Client does not support authentication protocol
requested by server..."

   This error is occurring because you are using the new password encryption
   that comes with MySQL 4.1, while your DBD::mysql module was compiled against
   an older version of MySQL. If you recompile DBD::mysql against the current
   MySQL libraries (or just obtain a newer version of this module) then the
   error may go away.

   If that does not fix the problem, or if you cannot recompile the existing
   module (e.g. you're running Windows) and/or don't want to replace it (e.g.
   you want to keep using a packaged version), then a workaround is available
   from the MySQL docs: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html
     _________________________________________________________________

Appendix C. Contrib

   There are a number of unofficial Bugzilla add-ons in the
   $BUGZILLA_ROOT/contrib/ directory. This section documents them.
     _________________________________________________________________

C.1. Command-line Search Interface

   There are a suite of Unix utilities for searching Bugzilla from the command
   line. They live in the contrib/cmdline directory. There are three files -
   query.conf, buglist and bugs.

   Warning These files pre-date the templatization work done as part of the
      2.16 release, and have not been updated.

   query.conf contains the mapping from options to field names and comparison
   types. Quoted option names are "grepped" for, so it should be easy to edit
   this file. Comments (#) have no effect; you must make sure these lines do
   not contain any quoted "option".

   buglist is a shell script that submits a Bugzilla query and writes the
   resulting HTML page to stdout. It supports both short options, (such as
   "-Afoo" or "-Rbar") and long options (such as "--assignedto=foo" or
   "--reporter=bar"). If the first character of an option is not "-", it is
   treated as if it were prefixed with "--default=".

   The column list is taken from the COLUMNLIST environment variable. This is
   equivalent to the "Change Columns" option that is available when you list
   bugs in buglist.cgi. If you have already used Bugzilla, grep for COLUMNLIST
   in your cookies file to see your current COLUMNLIST setting.

   bugs is a simple shell script which calls buglist and extracts the bug
   numbers from the output. Adding the prefix
   "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=" turns the bug list into a
   working link if any bugs are found. Counting bugs is easy. Pipe the results
   through sed -e 's/,/ /g' | wc | awk '{printf $2 "\n"}'

   Akkana Peck says she has good results piping buglist output through w3m -T
   text/html -dump
     _________________________________________________________________

C.2. Command-line 'Send Unsent Bug-mail' tool

   Within the contrib directory exists a utility with the descriptive (if
   compact) name of sendunsentbugmail.pl. The purpose of this script is,
   simply, to send out any bug-related mail that should have been sent by now,
   but for one reason or another has not.

   To accomplish this task, sendunsentbugmail.pl uses the same mechanism as the
   sanitycheck.cgi script; it scans through the entire database looking for
   bugs with changes that were made more than 30 minutes ago, but where there
   is no record of anyone related to that bug having been sent mail. Having
   compiled a list, it then uses the standard rules to determine who gets mail,
   and sends it out.

   As the script runs, it indicates the bug for which it is currently sending
   mail; when it has finished, it gives a numerical count of how many mails
   were sent and how many people were excluded. (Individual user names are not
   recorded or displayed.) If the script produces no output, that means no
   unsent mail was detected.

   Usage: move the sendunsentbugmail.pl script up into the main directory,
   ensure it has execute permission, and run it from the command line (or from
   a cron job) with no parameters.

Appendix D. Manual Installation of Perl Modules

D.1. Instructions

   If you need to install Perl modules manually, here's how it's done. Download
   the module using the link given in the next section, and then apply this
   magic incantation, as root:

bash# tar -xzvf <module>.tar.gz
bash# cd <module>
bash# perl Makefile.PL
bash# make
bash# make test
bash# make install

   Note In order to compile source code under Windows you will need to obtain a
   'make' utility. The nmake utility provided with Microsoft Visual C++ may be
   used. As an alternative, there is a utility called dmake available from CPAN
   which is written entirely in Perl. The majority of the links given below,
   however, are to pre-compiled versions of the modules, which can be installed
   on Windows simply by issuing the following command once you have downloaded
   the PPD file (which may be packaged within a ZIP file):

          > ppm install <filename.ppd>
     _________________________________________________________________

D.2. Download Locations

   Note Running Bugzilla on Windows requires the use of ActiveState Perl 5.8.1
   or higher. Some modules already exist in the core distribution of
      ActiveState Perl so no PPM link is given. (This is noted where it occurs.)

Appendix E. GNU Free Documentation License

   Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite
     330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and
     distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
     not allowed.
     _________________________________________________________________

0. Preamble

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
   document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
   freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
   commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
   author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
   considered responsible for modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
   the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
   GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
   software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
   should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
   But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any
   textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
   printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose
   is instruction or reference.
     _________________________________________________________________

1. Applicability and Definition

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms
   of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
   Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
   or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
   translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
   Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
   authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
   matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
   subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
   a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could
   be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related
   matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political
   position regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
   designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
   that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
   Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
   Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
   public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
   automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
   formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup
   has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers
   is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using
   a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for
   human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary
   formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
   SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
   available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors
   for output purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
   following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
   requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
   any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
   appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
   text.
     _________________________________________________________________

2. Verbatim Copying

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
   or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
   the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
   reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
   those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
   control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
   However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you
   distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
   conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
   may publicly display copies.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. Copying in Quantity

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
   the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
   copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
   Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
   cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
   publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with
   all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other
   material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
   covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
   conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
   you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
   actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
   than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
   with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general
   network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using
   public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must
   take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies
   in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus
   accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last
   time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
   retailers) of that edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
   a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
     _________________________________________________________________

4. Modifications

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
   Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
   role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
   Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
   these things in the Modified Version:

    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
       that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
       if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
       You may use the same title as a previous version if the original
       publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
       together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document
       (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
       the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
       of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
       required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an
       item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
       Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
       entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
       authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
       add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
       sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
       access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
       locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
       These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
       location for a work that was published at least four years before the
       Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
       to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve
       the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and
       tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
       given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
       text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
       considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
       included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in
       title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
   that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
   Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
   invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
   the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from
   any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
   but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
   statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
   organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
   Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
   and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by)
   any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same
   cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you
   are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the
   old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the
   old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
   permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
   endorsement of any Modified Version.
     _________________________________________________________________

5. Combining Documents

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
   provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
   of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
   Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
   identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
   are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
   make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
   parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
   known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
   titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
   combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
   various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
   combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
   "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."
     _________________________________________________________________

6. Collections of Documents

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
   collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
   copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
   individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
   into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
   regarding verbatim copying of that document.
     _________________________________________________________________

7. Aggregation with Independent Works

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the
   Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation.
   Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply
   to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
   account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative
   works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
   the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
   aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
   only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
   around the whole aggregate.
     _________________________________________________________________

8. Translation

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
   copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
   Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
   You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include
   the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this License,
   the original English version will prevail.
     _________________________________________________________________

9. Termination

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
   expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
   have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
   their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
     _________________________________________________________________

10. Future Revisions of this License

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
   Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or
   any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
   and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that
   has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
   any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
     _________________________________________________________________

How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
   License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
   just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute
     and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation
     License, Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software
     Foundation; with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A
     copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
     Documentation License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
   Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
   LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
   releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
   license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
   software.

   .htaccess
          Apache web server, and other NCSA-compliant web servers, observe the
          convention of using files in directories called .htaccess to restrict
          access to certain files. In Bugzilla, they are used to keep secret
          files which would otherwise compromise your installation - e.g. the
          localconfig file contains the password to your database. curious.

          serving up Bugzilla pages. Contrary to popular belief, the apache web
          server has nothing to do with the ancient and noble Native American
          tribe, but instead derived its name from the fact that it was "a
          patchy" version of the original NCSA world-wide-web server.

          Useful Directives when configuring Bugzilla

        AddHandler
                Tell Apache that it's OK to run CGI scripts.

        AllowOverride, Options
                These directives are used to tell Apache many things about the
                directory they apply to. For Bugzilla's purposes, we need them
                to allow script execution and .htaccess overrides.

        DirectoryIndex
                Used to tell Apache what files are indexes. If you can not add
                index.cgi to the list of valid files, you'll need to set
                $index_html to 1 in localconfig so ./checksetup.pl will create
                an index.html that redirects to index.cgi.

        ScriptInterpreterSource
                Used when running Apache on windows so the shebang line doesn't
                have to be changed in every Bugzilla script.

          For more information about how to configure Apache for Bugzilla, see
          Section 2.2.4.1.

B

   Bug
          A "bug" in Bugzilla refers to an issue entered into the database
          which has an associated number, assignments, comments, etc. Some also
          refer to a "tickets" or "issues"; in the context of Bugzilla, they
          are synonymous.

   Bug Number
          Each Bugzilla bug is assigned a number that uniquely identifies that
          bug. The bug associated with a bug number can be pulled up via a
          query, or easily from the very front page by typing the number in the
          "Find" box.

   Bugzilla
          Bugzilla is the world-leading free software bug tracking system.

C

   Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
          CGI is an acronym for Common Gateway Interface. This is a standard
          for interfacing an external application with a web server. Bugzilla
          is an example of a CGI application.

   Component
          A Component is a subsection of a Product. It should be a narrow
          category, tailored to your organization. All Products must contain at
          least one Component (and, as a matter of fact, creating a Product
          with no Components will create an error in Bugzilla).

   Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN)
          CPAN stands for the "Comprehensive Perl Archive Network". CPAN
          maintains a large number of extremely useful Perl modules -
          encapsulated chunks of code for performing a particular task.

   contrib
          The contrib directory is a location to put scripts that have been
          contributed to Bugzilla but are not a part of the official
          distribution. These scripts are written by third parties and may be
          in languages other than perl. For those that are in perl, there may
          be additional modules or other requirements than those of the
          official distribution.

      Note Scripts in the contrib directory are not officially supported by the
      Bugzilla team and may break in between versions.

D

   daemon
          A daemon is a computer program which runs in the background. In
          general, most daemons are started at boot time via System V init
          scripts, or through RC scripts on BSD-based systems. mysqld, the
          MySQL server, and apache, a web server, are generally run as daemons.

   DOS Attack
          A DOS, or Denial of Service attack, is when a user attempts to deny
          access to a web server by repeatedly accessing a page or sending
          malformed requests to a webserver. A D-DOS, or Distributed Denial of
          Service attack, is when these requests come from multiple sources at
          the same time. Unfortunately, these are much more difficult to defend
          against.

G

   Groups
          The word "Groups" has a very special meaning to Bugzilla. Bugzilla's
          main security mechanism comes by placing users in groups, and
          assigning those groups certain privileges to view bugs in particular
          Products in the Bugzilla database.

J

   JavaScript
          JavaScript is cool, we should talk about it.

M

   Message Transport Agent (MTA)
          A Message Transport Agent is used to control the flow of email on a
          system. The Email::Send Perl module, which Bugzilla uses to send
          email, can be configured to use many different underlying
          implementations for actually sending the mail using the
          mail_delivery_method parameter. Implementations other than sendmail
          require that the sendmailnow param be set to on.

   MySQL
          MySQL is currently the required RDBMS for Bugzilla. MySQL can be
          downloaded from http://www.mysql.com. While you should familiarize
          yourself with all of the documentation, some high points are:

        Backup
                Methods for backing up your Bugzilla database.

        Option Files
                Information about how to configure MySQL using my.cnf.

        Privilege System
                Much more detailed information about the suggestions in Section
                4.2.

   Product
          A Product is a broad category of types of bugs, normally representing
          a single piece of software or entity. In general, there are several
          Components to a Product. A Product may define a group (used for
          security) for all bugs entered into its Components.

   Perl
          First written by Larry Wall, Perl is a remarkable program language.
          It has the benefits of the flexibility of an interpreted scripting
          language (such as shell script), combined with the speed and power of
          a compiled language, such as C. Bugzilla is maintained in Perl.

Q

   QA
          "QA", "Q/A", and "Q.A." are short for "Quality Assurance". In most
          large software development organizations, there is a team devoted to
          ensuring the product meets minimum standards before shipping. This
          team will also generally want to track the progress of bugs over
          their life cycle, thus the need for the "QA Contact" field in a bug.

R

   Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS)
          A relational database management system is a database system that
          stores information in tables that are related to each other.

   Regular Expression (regexp)
          A regular expression is an expression used for pattern matching.

S

   Service
          In Windows NT environment, a boot-time background application is
          referred to as a service. These are generally managed through the
          control panel while logged in as an account with "Administrator"
          level capabilities. For more information, consult your Windows manual
          or the MSKB.

   SGML 
          SGML stands for "Standard Generalized Markup Language". Created in
          the 1980's to provide an extensible means to maintain documentation
          based upon content instead of presentation, SGML has withstood the
          test of time as a robust, powerful language. XML is the "baby
          brother" of SGML; any valid XML document it, by definition, a valid
          SGML document. The document you are reading is written and maintained
          in SGML, and is also valid XML if you modify the Document Type
          Definition.

T

   Target Milestone
          Target Milestones are Product goals. They are configurable on a
          per-Product basis. Most software development houses have a concept of
          "milestones" where the people funding a project expect certain
          functionality on certain dates. Bugzilla facilitates meeting these
          milestones by giving you the ability to declare by which milestone a
          bug will be fixed, or an enhancement will be implemented.

   Tool Command Language (TCL)
          TCL is an open source scripting language available for Windows,
          Macintosh, and Unix based systems. Bugzilla 1.0 was written in TCL
          but never released. The first release of Bugzilla was 2.0, which was
          when it was ported to perl.

Z

   Zarro Boogs Found
          This is just a goofy way of saying that there were no bugs found
          matching your query. When asked to explain this message, Terry had
          the following to say:

     I've been asked to explain this ... way back when, when Netscape released
   version 4.0 of its browser, we had a release party. Naturally, there had
   been a big push to try and fix every known bug before the release.
   Naturally, that hadn't actually happened. (This is not unique to Netscape or
   to 4.0; the same thing has happened with every software project I've ever
   seen.) Anyway, at the release party, T-shirts were handed out that said
   something like "Netscape 4.0: Zarro Boogs". Just like the software, the
   T-shirt had no known bugs. Uh-huh.
   So, when you query for a list of bugs, and it gets no results, you can think
   of this as a friendly reminder. Of *course* there are bugs matching your
      query, they just aren't in the bugsystem yet...
