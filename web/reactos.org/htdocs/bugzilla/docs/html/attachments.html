>&#13;      You should use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII
      data, such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it
      doesn't bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause people to
      receive fat, useless mails.
    </P
><P
>You should make sure to trim screenshots. There's no need to show the
      whole screen if you are pointing out a single-pixel problem.
    </P
><P
>Bugzilla stores and uses a Content-Type for each attachment
      (e.g. text/html). To download an attachment as a different
      Content-Type (e.g. application/xhtml+xml), you can override this
      using a 'content_type' parameter on the URL, e.g.
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#38;content_type=text/plain</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If you have a really large attachment, something that does not need to
      be recorded forever (as most attachments are), or something that is too
      big for your database, you can mark your attachment as a
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Big File"</SPAN
>, assuming the administrator of the installation
      has enabled this feature.  Big Files are stored directly on disk instead
      of in the database.  The maximum size of a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Big File"</SPAN
> is
      normally larger than the maximum size of a regular attachment. Independently
      of the storage system used, an administrator can delete these attachments
      at any time. Nevertheless, if these files are stored in the database, the
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"allow_attachment_deletion"</SPAN
> parameter (which is turned off
      by default) must be enabled in order to delete them.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Also, if the administrator turned on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"allow_attach_url"</SPAN
>
      parameter, you can enter the URL pointing to the attachment instead of
      uploading the attachment itself. For example, this is useful if you want to
      point to an external application, a website or a very large file. Note that
      there is no guarantee that the source file will always be available, nor
      that its content will remain unchanged.

>Viewing and reviewing patches in Bugzilla is often difficult due to
      lack of context, improper format and the inherent readability issues that
      raw patches present.  Patch Viewer is an enhancement to Bugzilla designed
      to fix that by offering increased context, linking to sections, and
      integrating with Bonsai, LXR and CVS.</P

        newer patch in Patch Viewer.  Then select the older patch from the
        dropdown at the top of the page ("Differences between [dropdown] and
        this patch") and click the "Diff" button. This will show you what
        is new or changed in the newer patch.</P

>To get more context in a patch, you put a number in the textbox at
        the top of Patch Viewer ("Patch / File / [textbox]") and hit enter.
        This will give you that many lines of context before and after each
        change. Alternatively, you can click on the "File" link there and it
        will show each change in the full context of the file. This feature only
        works against files that were diffed using "cvs diff".</P

        time), you can click the "(+)" and "(-)" links next to each file (to
        expand it or collapse it). If you want to collapse all files or expand
        all files, you can click the "Collapse All" and "Expand All" links at the
