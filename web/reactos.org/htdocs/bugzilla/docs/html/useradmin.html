          search in different ways the listbox to the right of the text entry

            This flag allows a user to create new products and components,

            If you use Bugzilla's keyword functionality, enabling this

            the keywords for existing bugs containing the keyword the user

            This flag allows a user to do what you're doing right now: edit
            other users. This will allow those with the right to do so to
            remove administrator privileges from other users or grant them to
            themselves. Enable with care.</P
