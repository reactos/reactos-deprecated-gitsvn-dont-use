>The Bugzilla Search page is the interface where you can find
    any bug report, comment, or patch currently in the Bugzilla system. You
    can play with it here: 
    <A

TARGET="_top"
>http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-3.0-branch/query.cgi</A
>.</P
><P
>The Search page has controls for selecting different possible
    values for all of the fields in a bug, as described above. For some
    fields, multiple values can be selected. In those cases, Bugzilla
    returns bugs where the content of the field matches any one of the selected
    values. If none is selected, then the field can take any value.</P
><P
>&#13;      Once you've run a search, you can save it as a Saved Search, which
      appears in the page footer.
      On the Saved Searches tab of your User Preferences page (the Prefs link
      in Bugzilla's footer), members of the group defined in the
      querysharegroup parameter can share such Saved Searches with user groups
      so that other users may use them.
      At the same place, you can see Saved Searches other users are sharing, and
      have them show up in your personal Bugzilla footer along with your own
      Saved Searches.
      If somebody is sharing a Search with a group she or he is allowed to
      <A
HREF="groups.html"
>assign users to</A
>, the sharer may opt to have
      the Search show up in the group's direct members' footers by default.

>&#13;        The boolean charts further restrict the set of results
        returned by a query. It is possible to search for bugs
        based on elaborate combinations of criteria.
      </P

>&#13;        The simplest boolean searches have only one term. These searches

        Using the "And," "Or," and "Add Another Boolean Chart" buttons,

>&#13;          Sometimes, a query needs to compare a field containing
          a user's ID (such as ReportedBy) with 
          a user's ID (such as the user running the query or the user
          to whom each bug is assigned). When the operator is either 
          "equals" or "notequals", the value can be "%reporter%", 
          "%assignee%", "%qacontact%", or "%user%."  The user pronoun
          refers to the user who is executing the query or, in the case
          of whining reports, the user who will be the recipient
          of the report. The reporter, assignee, and qacontact
          pronouns refer to the corresponding fields in the bug.

          negated. Negation permits queries such as

          If you wanted bugs where there is someone on the cc list

        it is often useful to have the list returned in something other

        you can specify several alternate formats. Besides the types described
        above, the following formats are also supported: ECMAScript, also known

>5.5.4. Adding/removing tags to/from bugs</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;        You can add and remove tags from individual bugs, which let you find and
        manage them more easily. Creating a new tag automatically generates a saved
        search - whose name is the name of the tag - which lists bugs with this tag.
        This saved search will be displayed in the footer of pages by default, as
        all other saved searches. The main difference between tags and normal saved
        searches is that saved searches, as described in the previous section, are
        stored in the form of a list of matching criteria, while the saved search
        generated by tags is a list of bug numbers. Consequently, you can easily
        edit this list by either adding or removing tags from bugs. To enable this
        feature, you have to turn on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Enable tags for bugs"</SPAN
> user
        preference, see <A
HREF="userpreferences.html"
>Section 5.10</A
>. This feature is disabled
        by default.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        This feature is useful when you want to keep track of several bugs, but
        for different reasons. Instead of adding yourself to the CC list of all
        these bugs and mixing all these reasons, you can now store these bugs in
        separate lists, e.g. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Keep in mind"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Interesting bugs"</SPAN
>,
        or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Triage"</SPAN
>. One big advantage of this way to manage bugs
        is that you can easily add or remove bugs one by one, which is not
        possible to do with saved searches without having to edit the search
        criteria again.
