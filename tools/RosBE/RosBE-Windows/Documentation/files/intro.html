<p>First of all, lets answer the main question: What is RosBE?<br>
Its a Environment for building ReactOS on your own, its based on GCC
4.1.3
Compiler and aims to be the one and only Build Environment for absolute
Beginners up to skilled devs.</p>
<p>Realizing this wide spectrum in one BE is quite difficult of course.<br>
How, as an example, do you tell a newbie how to use SVN or
maintain/update a
Source tree?<br>
Easy. This package has the typical, well known SVN for all advanced
devs and a
slim Version specially made for newbies, called sSVN (Simple SVN),
which only
does the main stuff and has no difficult to understand or even
dangerous, if
wrong used, functions. Additionally it checks the working folder, if
its empty
or not. If its no empty folder, it does not even allow the User to
continue.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning of a big list of features.<br>
Devs will be happy with the included GDB and raddr2line.<br>
Multi Core PC Users will love "makex" which automatically detects the
number of
CPU Cores and optimizes the Build process to that Number.<br>
Easy to maintain several trees by making Shortcuts to the paths with
our tool, SCut.<br>
Setting of a dozen of build parameters with a easy to understand
Configurator App.<br>
etc...<br>
